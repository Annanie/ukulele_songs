Tom Cruise Crazy
E             G#              C#7   
Tom Cruise is so in love with Katie
F#m                              B7  
At least all his people tell him so
             E                   G#           C#7  
And while he thinks that she's a very special lady
F#m                                      B7  G# 
It's probably not the way he'd choose to go  
      A           E                   F#m                C#m     
And a lifetime of longing looks would cause too much distraction
A                      E        B7   
Good thing that he's not gay anymore
       
Chorus
E   G#        A          E     
Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise crazy
F#m               B7      E     B7 
Just be glad it's him not you   
E      G#       A        E       
If you had Tom Cruise's troubles
     F#m                B7    G#  
You might be Tom Cruise crazy too
      C#m                  E7          
You'd flash your big white shiny smile
      A             Am    
You'd buy expensive shoes
          E       G#  C#7          
But you'd be the only man on Earth
     F#m       B7      E      
Who couldn't enjoy Tom Cruise
                                        
C#7     F#m        B7      E (re-intro)
                                     
Oh no, you couldn't enjoy Tom Cruise
        
Verse 2
E             G#             C#7   
Tom Cruise is always getting older
F#m				   B7                             
He knows he'll never be that young again
    E                     G#            C#7      
And when Tom Cruise looks back over his shoulder
F#m                                B7  G# 
He sees a thousand younger leading men 
   A                   E            
He knows someday he'll have to play
   F#m          C#m     
An old retarded grandpa
      A               E              B7  
While someone younger plays his sexy son
       
Chorus
E   G#        A          E     
Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise crazy
F#m               B7      E     B7 
Just be glad it's him not you   
E      G#       A        E       
If you had Tom Cruise's troubles
     F#m                B7    G#  
You might be Tom Cruise crazy too
      C#m                  E7          
You'd flash your big white shiny smile
      A             Am    
You'd buy expensive shoes
          E       G#  C#7          
But you'd be the only man on Earth
     F#m       B7      E      
Who couldn't enjoy Tom Cruise
                                        
C#7     F#m        B7      E (re-intro)
                                     
Oh no, you couldn't enjoy Tom Cruise
       
Bridge
C                G                   Am        Em  
Tom Cruise knows somewhere there's a place for him
C           G             Am     B7 
He's not of this world anymore...
        
Verse 3
E            G#            C#7    
Somewhere in some secluded castle
F#m                                 B7   
Poor Tom Cruise sits staring at the wall
        E                G#            C#7    
And the outside world is always such a hassle
F#m                          B7  G# 
Sometimes he won't go out at all 
          A            E             
There are millions who know his name
F#m       C#m       
Everybody loves him
A              E            B7    
Why is it that he feels so alone?
       
Chorus
E   G#        A          E     
Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise crazy
F#m               B7      E     B7 
Just be glad it's him not you   
E      G#       A        E       
If you had Tom Cruise's troubles
     F#m                B7    G#  
You might be Tom Cruise crazy too
      C#m                  E7          
You'd flash your big white shiny smile
      A             Am    
You'd buy expensive shoes
          E       G#  C#7          
But you'd be the only man on Earth

The Lumberjack Song

Terry Jones &amp; Michael Palin


A                    D            
oh, I'm a lumberjack and I'm okay
  E                     A            
I sleep all night and I work all day
A                     D

I cut down trees, I eat my lunch
  E                 A 
I go to the lavatory
  A              D          
On wednesdays I go shopping
    E              A             
And have buttered scones for tea
A                      D              
He cuts down trees, he eats his lunch

I like to press wildflowers

And hang around in bars

Don't think twice, It's Alright
Bob Dyla


D                  A              Bm        
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
G                  D    A 
It don't matter anyhow. 
D                      A              Bm        
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
E7                   A    A7 
If you don't know by now. 
D                              D7            
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
G                        E7           
Look out your window and I'll be gone
D          A          Bm         G  
You're the reason I'm travellin' on
D           A             D      A 
Don't think twice, it's alright. 
D                  A               Bm          
It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
G               D      A 
A light I never knowed 
D                  A               Bm          
It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
E7                          A    A7 
I'm on the dark side of the road 
D                                         D7        
But I wish there were something you would do or say
G                            E7            
To try and make me change my mind and stay
D        A            Bm         G   
We never did too much talkin' anyway
D              A             D      A 
So don't think twice, it's alright. 
D                     A              Bm        
So it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal

Like you never done before 
D                  A              Bm        
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal

I can't hear you anymore 
D                                     D7             
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wonderin' walking down the road
G                       E7              
I once loved a woman, a child I am told
D               A             Bm        G

Oh lord, won't you buy me a mercedes benz ?

Don't Go Away Mad (Just Go Away)

M�tley Cr�e (Transponeras g�rna upp tv� steg f�r att bli mer spelbar)


C                     Dm                    
We could sail away or catch a freight train
     F           C                
Or a rocket ship into outer space
        C                   Dm               
Nothin' left to do too many things were said
   F                      C             
To ever make it feel like yesterday did
C                             Dm                   
Seasons must change, separate paths, separate ways
      F                        C                    
If we blame it anything, let's blame it on the rain
  C                      Dm                      
I knew it all along, I'd have to write this song
   F                               C                 
To young to fall in love, guess we knew it all along
        
Chorus:
         Bb           F  
That's alright, that'sOK
        C                                                     
We were walkin' through some youth, smilin' through some pain
         Bb           F  
That's alright, that'sOK
              F     
Let's turn the page
                                        
My friends called today, down from L.A.
                                                            
They were shootin' pool all night and sleepin' half the day
                                                   
They said I could crash if I could find my own way
                                                 
I told them you were leaving on a bus to go away
                          
That's alright, that's OK
                                                
We were two kids in love tryin' to find our way
                          
That's alright, that's OK
                                                     
Held our dreams in our hands, let our minds run away
                          
That's alright, that's OK
                                                              
We were walkin' through some youth, smilin' through some pain
                                    
That's alright, let's turn the page
    G                                         
And remember what I say, and it goes this way
C          D            
Girl, don't go away mad
F              C    
Girl, just go away!

Intro:
    D            A7              D6    D#dim     A      
I'm leaning on a lamp, maybe you think, I look a tramp,
           D         D6       E7       A7            D   Fdim Em7 A7 
Or you may think I'm hanging 'round to steal a motor-car.  
    D            A7                D6    D#dim          A7    
But no I'm not a crook, And if you think, that's what I look,
              A                 Bm      E7      A7   Em7 A7 
I'll tell you why I'm here, And what my motives are.

I'm leaning on a lamp-post at the corner of the street,
          A7                        D   
In case a certain little lady comes by.
   Em7 A7  D  Bm7 
Oh me,  oh my,
  A               E7         A  A7 
I hope the little lady comes by.
  D                                                           
I don't know if she'll get away, She doesn't always get away,
    A7                        D    
But anyhow I know that she'll try.

I won't have to ask what she's late for, She wouldn't have to leave me flat,

She's not a girl like that.

Penny Lane

Beatles


      D                Bm             Em7        A7 
Penny Lane: there is a barber showing photographs
         D                 Bm          Dm7   
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know.
            Bm7                  Bb  
And all the people that come and go
         A7        G 
Stop and say hello.
      C                         Em7  F   
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
C                         Em7   F    
Wet beneath the blue suburban skies,
          Gdim      A7 
I sit and meanwhile:
                                            
On the corner is a banker with a motor car.
                                                  
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
                                   
And the banker never wears a 'mac'
                     
In the pouring rain.
                                         
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
                                     
Wet beneath the blue suburban skies,
                     
I sit and meanwhile:
                                                          
Back in Penny Lane: there is a fireman with an hourglass.
                                              
And in his pocket is a portrait of the queen.
                                        
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
                      
It's a clean machine.
                                         
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
                                     
Wet beneath the blue suburban skies,
                     
I sit and meanwhile:
                                                        
Back in Penny Lane: the barber shaves another customer.
                                                
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trend.
                               
And then the fireman rushes in
                       
From the pouring rain.
                                         
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
                                     
Wet beneath the blue suburban skies,
                          
I sit and meanwhile back:
      D                         F#m7 G   
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
D                         F#m7  G

D              F#7         B7  
 But when I began to fall solo
G        B7                Em     B7  Em  
 Nobody want� me hanging round their door
G               G#dim     D   F#7 B    
 It�s mighty strange, without a doubt,
E7                             A7           
 Nobody wants you when you�re down and out.

Oh, nobody loves you,
G             B7      Em B7 Em

 In your pocket, not one penny,

 And your friends, you haven�t got any

One more time, when you�re down and out.

 G              B7           
Five foot two, eyes of blue,
 E7                              
Oh, what those five feet can do!

Now, if you run into a five foot two
     E7               
All covered with fur,
 A7                                 
Diamond rings and all those things,
 D        Ddim    am7   D7  
Bet your life it isn't her.
 D+  G               B7            
But could she love, could she woo,
 E7                                  
Could she, could she, could she coo?
    C         D      G    f#m7 E7 
Has anybody seen my gal?     
    C         D      G    C G 
Has anybody seen my gal?

Always

Intro Verse:
 C                    Gdim G7                  
Ev'rything went wrong, and the whole day long,
     Dm7 G7  C     Fdim  G7 
And feel so blue.        
 C              Gdim   G7                    
For the longest while,  I'd forgot to smile,
     Dm7 G7  C  C7  
Then  I  met you.
 Em          C7              B7    
Now that my blue days have passed,
                           Em      Gdim 
Now that I've found you at last.   
        
Melody:
C                           G7                       C     
I'll be loving you always, with a love that's true always.
C                    C7      E                   
When the things you planned need a helping hand,
B7                E       G7      
I will understand always, always.
C                       C7    B7  Bb7 
Days may not be fair always;      
A7                          Dm    
That's when I'll be there always.
F6             Dm7-5  C              D9   
Not for just an hour, not for just a day,
G7                       C               G7 
Not for just a year, but always.         



The Drugs I Need

The Austin Lounge Lizards


             C         
You've got a headache,
         G                         
And I've got some strange disease.
             D        
Don't worry about it!
               C                G     
This pill will set your mind at ease.
                   C        
It's called Progenitorivox,
         G                     
And it's made by SquabbMerlCo.
       D                       
It's a life-enhancing miracle,
              C                      D     
But there are some things you should know.
              
It may cause:
G         
Agitation
E7           
Palpitations
A7        D7         
Excessive salivation

Bad vibrations
C             Cm               
Mild electric shock sensations
G        Em       
But it's worth it
A7      D7      G    Em A7 D7 
For the drugs I need   
     Bm                      
My disease may not be fatal,
    Em                  
But I can ease my fears
   A7                             
By taking two twelve-dollar pills
     D7                   
Each day for fifty years.
              Bm                       
They've spent billions to convince me,
   Em            
So now I realize
   A7                D7                 
Progenitorivox beats diet and exercise.
           C        
I've got insurance.
   G                    
At least for now, I do.
    D                    
And if I bought generic,
         C               G    
It would cut my costs in two.
                    C       
But I *want* Progenitorivox
         G             
'Cause I saw it on TV.
      D                              
Those families looked so functional,
     C                  D   
That paisley pill's for me!
                  
But it may cause:
G           
Deprivation
E7         
Humilation
A7                   
Debtors' Prison, and

Dark depictions

Empty pockets
G7            
Court dockets
C                 Cm               
May cause eyes to pop from sockets
G        Em       
But it's worth it
A7      D7      G    Em A7 D7 
For the drugs I need   
G        Em       
But it's worth it
                                            
(interrupting, to the tune of "O, Canada!")
G          
In Canada,
     Am7            D7    
They get this for a song!
G        Em       
But it's worth it
A7      D7      G    Em A7 D7 
For the drugs I need   
G  Em A7 D7

Almost heaven, West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
                   Bm                    A                          
Life is old there, older than the trees, younger than the mountains
G                    D  
growin' like a breeze.
        D              A            Bm        G     
Country roads, take me home, to the place I belong.

All my mem'ries, gather round her, miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
                                                             
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine
                    
teardrop in my eye.

I hear her voice in the morning hour she calls me,
    G        D              A             
the radio reminds her of my home far away
    Bm               A            G       
and driving down the road I get a feeling
       D                     A          A7    D    
that I should have been home yesterday, yesterday.

Country roads, take me home, to the place I belong.

I keep my eyes wide open all the time.
           GF                        C     
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds

I find myself alone when day is through

You've got a way to keep me on your side
            G7                          C    
You give me cause for love that I can't hide

For you I know I'd even turn the tide

I keep my eyes wide open all the time.
           F                         C     
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
               G7               C    
Because you're mine, I walk the line

Gm                      C    
When are you gonna come down
F                     Bb   
When are you going to land
  Gm                        C                 
I should have stayed on the farm, should have
F                  F   
listened to my old man
    Gm                        C    
You know you can't hold me forever
  F                   Bb  
I didn't sign up with you
    Eb                     C               
I'm not a present for your friends to open
     F                     F           
This boy's too young to be singing the
Db  Eb   Ab  Db   Db  C7  
blues... Ah...... Ah....
         
(CHORUS)
   F                    A7   
So Goodbye yellow brick road
          Bb              F    
where the dogs of society howl
    D7                     Gm        
You can't plant me in your penthouse
    C                F    
I'm going back to my plow
Dm                      A                
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Bb                      Db   
Hunting the horny black toad
Db  Eb      F          C       Dm         F 
... Oh I've finally decided my future lies
   Bb      C            
Beyond the yellow brick

road... Ah..... Ah......
          
(VERSE 2)
                                  
What do you think you'll do then?
                               
I bet to shoot down your plane
                                            
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
                              
to set you on your feet again
                               
Maybe you'll get a replacement
                                   
There's plenty like me to be found
                               
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
                                     
Sniffing for titbits like you on the
                        
ground... Ah.... Ah....

Great Lake Swimmers - Your Rocky Spine




      Em          D     
I was lost in the lakes
	A		 C                              
And the shapes that your body makes
	  Em			D                                  
That your body makes, that your body makes
     
A		C
                     
That your body makes
D C D C 
      
    Em			   D                            
The mountains said I could find you here
       
A				C
                                                 
They whispered the snow and the leaves in my ear
   Em               D                
I traced my finger along your trails
     A         	        C               
Your body was the map, I was lost in it
G		   D                        
Floating over your rocky spine
    A			   C	      D                       
The glaciers made you, and now you�re mine
G		   D                        
Floating over your rocky spine
    A			   C	      D                       
The glaciers made you, and now you�re mine
Em D A C  
*Em D A C
      Em                 D             
I was moving across your frozen veneer
    A		     C                       
The sky was dark but you were clear
Em		  D                     
Could you feel my footsteps
	      A		                   C                      
And would you shatter, would you shatter, would you
D C D C 
      
	      Em	     D                            
And with your soft fingers between my claws
     A       C              
Like purity against resolve
	Em				   D                                                     
I could tell, then and there, that we were formed from the clay
       
A				C
                                                 
And came from the rocks for the earth to display
     Em		   D                       
They told me to be careful up there
	  A         		C                                       
Where the wind blows a venomous rage through your hair
     Em		   D                       
They told me to be careful up there
	  A			  C                             
Where the wind rages through your hair
Em D A C

I'm a rover

Irish trad.


       D      G      D     
I'm a rover, seldom sober,
 G     D        G        A  
I'm a rover of high degree
                D           G       D      
It's when I'm drinkin' I'm always thinkin'
 G      D              A    D  
how to gain my love's company
                                        
Though the night be as dark as dungeon,
                             
not a star can be seen above
                                    
I will be guided without a stumble,
                                  
into the arms of my own true love
                           
I'm a rover, seldom sober,
                           
I'm a rover of high degree
                                           
It's when I'm drinkin' I'm always thinkin'
                              
how to gain my love's company
                                     
He stepped up to her bedroom window,
                             
kneeling gently upon a stone
                                        
He whispers through her bedroom window,
                                 
my darling dear do you lie alone
                           
I'm a rover, seldom sober,
                           
I'm a rover of high degree
                                           
It's when I'm drinkin' I'm always thinkin'
                              
how to gain my love's company
                                  
It's only me your own true lover,
                            
open the door and let me in
                                         
For I have come on a long nights journey
                                  
and I'm near drenched to the skin
                           
I'm a rover, seldom sober,
                           
I'm a rover of high degree
                                           
It's when I'm drinkin' I'm always thinkin'
                              
how to gain my love's company
                                                
She opened the door with the greatest pleasure,
                                       
she opened the door and she let him in
                                               
They both shook hands and embraced each other,
                                  
until the morning they lay as one
                           
I'm a rover, seldom sober,
                           
I'm a rover of high degree
                                           
It's when I'm drinkin' I'm always thinkin'
                              
how to gain my love's company
                                         
Says I: My love I must go and leave you,
                                      
to climb the hills they are far above
                                             
But I will climb with the greatest pleasure,
                                       
since I've been in the arms of my love
                           
I'm a rover, seldom sober,
                           
I'm a rover of high degree
                                           
It's when I'm drinkin' I'm always thinkin'

I.......  I've got a low-down dirty feeling
                        G                Gm 
That I've been cheated on and lied to    
        D                       Dmaj7 
If it's wrong, then it's wrong  
                Bm        D 
We broke up for so long   
       G                                Gm    Bb    A7 
Why don't we have that magic anymore?

I've got a strange, sneaking suspicion
                     G                   Gm 
That it's been goin on for sometime now  
              D                  Dmaj7 
Something shines in your eyes    
                  Bm          D 
Something stirs deep inside   
  G                          A      D   D7 
I won't stand in your way anymore

You say that I'm just a little boy

Who's easily lead astray

Where are you, that same little girl

I....... I've got a low-down dirty feeling

That I've been cheated on and lied to

If it's wrong, then it's wrong

(it should be E/B/F#/B but this is easier to play ;)
                           F   
Don't fall in love with me yet
                 C   
We only recently met
                          G   
True I'm in love with you but
                       C   
you might decide I'm a nut
                      F  
Give me a week or two to
                 C   
go absolutely cuckoo
                          G    
then, when you see your error,
                         C   
then, you can flee in terror
                    F    
like everybody else does
                     C     
I only tell you this cause
                    G  
I'm easy to get rid of
                       C    
but not if you fall in love
                         F    
Know now that I'm on the make
                     C    
and if you make a mistake
                         G    
my heart will certainly break
                       C    
I'll have to jump in a lake
                              F   
and all my friends will blame you
                                C  
There's no telling what they'll do
                       G   
It's only fair to tell you
                  C   
I'm absolutely cuckoo

















If you could read my mind        

Gordon Lightfoot


G                                  
  If you could read my mind, love,
F                                     
  What a tale my thoughts could tell.
G                              
  Just like an old time movie,
F                                    
  'Bout a ghost from a wishing well.
G              G7   
  In a castle dark,
     C                     D              Em    
Or a fortress strong, with chains upon my feet.
    C                  G   
You know that ghost is me,
      C          G            
And I will never be set free,
   C             D                    G    
As long as I'm a ghost that you can't see.
G                                  
  If you could read my mind, love,
F                                       
  What a tale your thoughts could tell.
G                              
  Just like a paperback novel,
F                               
  The kind the drugstores sell.
G                           
  Then you reached the part
          C                    D             Em  
Where the heartaches come, the hero would be me.
    C            G     
But heroes often fail.
        C               G           
And you won't read that book again,
        C            D                G     
Because the ending's just too hard to take.
G        G7   
I'd walk away
       C                    D                     Em      
Like a movie star, who gets burned in a three-way script.
C            G    
Enter number two:
  C              G              
A movie queen to play the scene
   C                D                   G  
Of bringing all the good things back to me
    C              G              
But for now, love, let's be real.
  C                      G              
I never thought, I could feel this way.
         C                 D                   
And I've got to say that I  just don't get it.
C                  G              
I don't know where we went wrong,
        C                     D                 G     
But the feeling's gone, and I just can't get it back.
G                                  
If you could read my mind love ...
F                                     
  What a tale my thoughts could tell.
G                              
  Just like an old time movie,
F                                    
  'Bout a ghost from a wishing well.
G             G7    
  In a castle dark,
     C                     D              Em    
Or a fortress strong, with chains upon my feet.
    C              G   
But stories always end
      C         G                 
And if you read between the lines
     C                  D        G          
Youll know that Im just tryin to understand
    C                G    
The feelins that you lack
  C                      G              
I never thought, I could feel this way.
         C                 D                   
And I've got to say that I  just don't get it.
C                  G              
I don't know where we went wrong,
        C                     D                 G     
But the feeling's gone, and I just can't get it back.

Killing me softly

Text: Norman Gimbel, Musik: Charles Fox


Am          D                G           C           
I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style.
Am        D                  Em                 
And so I came to see him to listen for a while.
Am            D                 G            B7        
And there he was this young boy, a stranger to my eyes
Em                          C      
strumming my pain with his fingers
D                         G     
singing my life with his words.
Em                      Am       
Killing me softly with his song,
            D           C        
killing me softly with his song,
             G              C         
telling my whole life with his words,
            F               E    E7 
killing me softly with his song. 
                                                         
I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd,
                                                       
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud.
                                                        
I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on
                                    
strumming my pain with his fingers,
                                
singing my life with his words.
                                 
Killing me softly with his song,
                                 
killing me softly with his song,
                                      
telling my whole life with his words,
                                 
killing me softly with his song.
                                                  
He sang as if he knew me, in all my dark despair,
                                                         
and then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there
                                                         
But he was there this stranger, singing clear and strong
                                   
strumming my pain with his fingers
                                
singing my life with his words.
                                 
Killing me softly with his song,
                                 
killing me softly with his song,
                                      
telling my whole life with his words,
                                 
killing me softly with his song.

Just someone, I used to spend some time with

Just a flame that's lost it's glow

D   C              G       
Big wheels keep on turning
D        C              G   
Carry me home to see my kin
D       C               G         
Singing songs about the Southland
D          C           G    
I miss ole 'bamy once again
                       
And I think it's a sin
D            C                  G        
Well I heard Mister Young sing about her
D                C            G    
Well I heard ol' Neil put her down
D                C            G      
Well I hope Neil Young will remember
D          C                            G   
A southern man don't need him around anyhow

Lord, I'm coming home to you
D         C                 G       
In Birmingham they love the Gov'nor
D          C                 G  
Now we all did what we could do
D        C             G         
Now Watergate does not bother me
D         C                 G    
Does your conscience bother you?
                
Tell the truth!
       
Chorus
D          C                  G        
Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers
D                C                       G   
And they've been known to pick a tune or two
D         C          G       
Lord they get me off so much
D            C                   G    
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue
                   
Now how about you?

Behind Blue Eyes




Em                     G    
No one knows what it's like
          Dsus2 D  
To be the  bad man
Bm7 C              
To  be the sad man
  A9             
Behind blue eyes
    Em                     G    
And no one knows what it's like
      Dsus2 D  
To be hated
   Bm7 C    
To be fated
   A9                 
To  telling only lies
       C       D 
But my  dreams 
               G     
They aren't as empty
      C           D         E  
As my  conscience  seems to be
       Bm              C   
I have  hours, only lonely
           D         
My love is vengeance
             A9   
That's never free



It's Only A Paper Moon

Music:	Harold Arlen, Text: Edgar Yipsel Harburg and Billy Rose


G        E7    Am7   D7      
Say, it's only a paper moon,
 D       D9     G    D7   G    D9 
Sailing over a cardboard sea,  
G       E7          Am7     D7   
But it wouldn't be make believe,
   Am7    D7       G    D7 
If you believed in me.  
G         E7      Am7     D7  
Yes, it's only a canvas sky,
  D      D9    G  D7   G     D9 
Hanging over a muslin tree,  
G       E7         Am7     D7    
But it wouldn't be make believe,
   Am7     D7      G   G7 
If you believed in me. 
        
Bridge:
    Am7 Gdim Bm    Bm7 
Without your love, 
        Am7   D7     G     G7 
It's a honky tonk parade,  
    Am7 Gdim  Bm   Bm7 
Without your love, 
       G       E7	  A9     D7+5         
It's a melody played at a penny arcade.
G       E7         Am7     D7   
It's a Barnum and Bailey world,
  D      D9      G   D7 G    D9 
Just as phony as it can be,  
G       E7         Am7     D7    
But it wouldn't be make believe,
   Am7    D7       G   
If you believed in me.



November 

Laleh


G               Dm 
Well you know me
                 C     
I've never been afraid
               Em     
I always jump into it
                   D             
With my whole heart and no shame
G                               Dm  
And the thoughts that I'm left with
                  C   
Is making such a mess
                       Em      
There's nothing more confusing
               D                      Em C G Bm 
than the loss You've caused yourself         
Bm                  
and, all in all ...
D                           
It feels you're like me and
G               C              Am7     
Were the trees still green in november
       D           G               C        Am7     
And I know I cant remember summer being so gone But
    D         Bm                           C    
I will play along But it feels It feels so much
         Am7                   G    
That we don't know what we're doing
    Bm                                     
And I never knew, never thought They could
C                          Am7                     G    
play along honey But they don't know what they're doing
G                   Dm      
And I know I won't admit it
                     C     
And I don't want to say it
                      Em             
But I still look for you in the park
       D             G  
On my way home each day
                 Dm      
And no, I won't admit it
                 C     
Not even to my friends
                      Em  
They think I'm doing well
            D         G  
And I even lie to myself
                       Dm                  
How long can u keep a secret from yourself
C                                    Em                      
Like that storm that blew me back 2 years To that first step
D                 G                        
I took away from you And the hope that you
Dm                      C                          
left It's hidden in my room I'm a strong woman But
Em             D              Em C G Bm 
sometimes I'm weak for you           
Bm             
And on and on,
D                                                       
I close my eyes and I'm still there I'm still there ...
G               C              Am7     
Were the trees still green in november
       D           G               C        Am7     
And I know I cant remember summer being so gone But
    D         Bm                           C    
I will play along But it feels It feels so much
         Am7                   G    
That we don't know what we're doing
    Bm                                     
And I never knew, never thought They could
C                                                  G    
play along honey But they don't know what they're doing
D                                          
I close my eyes and I'm still there.......

Let it Be

John Lennon/Paul McCartney


        D              A                
When I find myself in times of trouble,
  Bm         G           
Mother Mary comes to me,
  D                A             G  D 
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
                    A       
And in my hour of darkness,
         Bm               G           
She is standing right in front of me,
  D                A             G  D 
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
       Bm         A          G          D   
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
                    A           G  D 
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.
    D               A              
And when the broken hearted people
Bm            G            
Living in the world agree,
D                A              G  D 
There will be an answer, let it be.
                        A       
But though there may be parted,
         Bm                  G              
There is still a chance that they will see,
D                  A            G  D 
There will be an answer, let it be.
       Bm         A          G          D   
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
                    A           G  D 
There will be an answer, let it be.
    D                 A       
And when the night is cloudy,
         Bm                 G             
There is still a light that shines on me,
D              A             G  D 
Shine until tomorrow, let it be.
                 A               
I wake up to the sound of music,
   Bm       G            
Mother Mary comes to me,
D                 A              G  D 
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
       Bm         A          G          D   
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
                    A           G  D 
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

Intro A7
Am                                  G                       
They say that Richard Cory owns one half of this whole town
     Am                       E7                       
With political connections to spread his wealth around
D5                                      
Born into society a banker's only child
       Am   G       C               E7                     
He had everything a man could want; power, grace and style
C                    Am      
But I -- work in his factory
      D5                         
And i curse the life I'm living,
                       
And I curse my poverty
                            C                      Am  
And i wish that I could be, oh I wish that I could be

Oh I wish that i could be   -    Richard Cory
     Am                             G                  
The papers print his picture almost everywhere he goes
         Am                        E7             
Richard Cory at the opera, Richard Cory at a show
         D5                                                
And the rumours of his parties and the orgies on his yacht
        Am     G       C          E7                 
Oh, he surely must be happy with everything he's got
C                    Am      
But I -- work in his factory
      D5                         
And I curse the life I'm living,
                       
And I curse my poverty
                            C                      Am  
And i wish that I could be, oh I wish that I could be
     D5                D7                Am   
Oh I wish that i could be   -    Richard Cory
    Am                          G                    
He freely gave to charities, he had the common touch
               Am                                  E7                    
And they were grateful for his patronage, and they thanked him very much
      D5                                                          
So my mind was filled with wonder when the evening headlines read
Am      G         C                         Am                      
Richard Cory went home last night and put a bullet through his head
C                    Am      
But I -- work in his factory
      D5                         
And i curse the life I'm living,
                       
And I curse my poverty
                            C                      Am  
And i wish that I could be, oh I wish that I could be
     D5                E7                Am   
Oh I wish that i could be   -    Richard Cory



Say Yes

by Elliott Smith, from the album either/or


G      Bm            Em                 D         C                 G                  A7     
i'm in love with the world, through the eyes of a girl, who's still around the morning after.
G        Bm         Em         D                C            G                  A7     
we broke up a month ago, and i grew up i didn't know, i'd be around the morning after.
G           Bm            Em           D                C                  G                A7     
it's always been wait and see, a happy day and then you pay, and feel like shit the morning after.
G         Bm           Em          D                  C                  G              A7     
but now i feel changed around, and instead of falling down, i'm standing up the morning after.
C    D                Em             G                 A7     C 
situations get fucked up, and turned around, sooner or later. 
G       Bm         Em          D                C                 G           A7     
i could be another fool, or an exception to the rule; you tell me the morning after.
G       Cdim               Em        F              Em           D               C      
crooked spin can't come to rest; i'm damaged bad at best; she'll decide what she wants.
G             Cdim           Em           F             Em     
i'll probably be the last to know; no one says until it shows;
    D      Am          G    F      Em   Cm            G   
see how it is ... they want you or they don't ... say yes
G      Bm            Em                 D         C                 G                  A7     
i'm in love with the world, through the eyes of a girl, who's still around the morning after.



What a Wonderful World




            C       Em        F            C  
Well I see trees of green and red roses too,
F               C         E7     Am  
I'll watch then bloom for me and you

Well I see skies of blue and I see clouds of white and the brightness of day
E7         Am          F               G                C        F    C

    G                        C                 
The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
    G                    C                 
are also on the faces of people passing by
      F               C              F          C   
I see friends shaking hands saying, �How do you do?
F              C       Dm7             G  
They're really saying, I,      I love you
       C      Em        F          C     
I hear babies cry and I watch them grow,
F                  C     E7        Am   
They'll learn much more than we'll know
      F                G                Am     F 
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

Irish Rover

Pogues


       A                 D  
On the Fourth of July, 1806
   A                               D    
We set sail from the sweet cove of Cork
        A                            D      
We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks
        A          E           A    
For the Grand City Hall in New York
                        
'Twas a wonderful craft
        E                   
She was rigged fore and aft
        A                 E         
And oh, how the wild wind drove her
                 A       
She stood several blasts
                     D     
She had twenty seven masts
         A              E     D  A  
And they called her The Irish Rover
                                               
We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags
                                    
We had two million barrels of stone
                                                     
We had three million sides of old blind horses hides
                                     
We had four million barrels of bones
                         
We had five million hogs
                     
And six million dogs
                                
Seven million barrels of porter
                                                     
We had eight million bails of old nanny-goats' tails
                               
In the hold of the Irish Rover
                           
There was awl Mickey Coote
                             
Who played hard on his flute
                                   
When the ladies lined up for a set
                          
He was tootin' with skill
                             
For each sparkling quadrille
                                          
Though the dancers were fluther'd and bet
                          
With his smart witty talk
                        
He was cock of the walk
                                       
And he rolled the dames under and over
                          
They all knew at a glance
                           
When he took up his stance
                                  
That he sailed in The Irish Rover
                       
There was Barney McGee
                          
From the banks of the Lee
                                   
There was Hogan from County Tyrone
                        
There was Johnny McGurk
                             
Who was scared stiff of work
                                       
And a man from Westmeath called Malone
                          
There was Slugger O'Toole
                        
Who was drunk as a rule
                                    
And Fighting Bill Treacy from Dover
                           
And your man, Mick MacCann
                           
From the banks of the Bann
                                   
Was the skipper of the Irish Rover
                          
We had sailed seven years
                           
When the measles broke out
                                     
And the ship lost its way in the fog
                         
And that whale of a crew
                        
Was reduced down to two
                                      
Just myself and the Captain's old dog
                            
Then the ship struck a rock
                      
Oh Lord! what a shock
                                   
The bulkhead was turned right over
                         
Turned nine times around
                                 
And the poor old dog was drowned
                               
And the las of The Irish Rover










The wild rover

the Dubliners


     G                            C    
I've been a wild rover for many a year
  G            C        D7          G    
I spent all me money on whiskey and beer
    G                                    C     
But now I'm returning with gold in great store
    G            C        D7            G    
And I never will play the wild rover no more
        
chorus:
         D7           G                C    
And it's no nay never, no nay never no more
       G             C         D7        G    
Will I play the wild rover, no never, no more
  G                                   C     
I went in to an alehouse I used to frequent
      G            C       D7        G     
And I told the landlady me money was spent
  G                                      C     
I asked her for credit, she answered me "Nay!"
      G         C             D7       G     
"Such custom as yours I could have any day!"
       
chorus
  G                                    C      
I took out of me pocket ten sovereigns bright
        G          C           D7          G     
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight
    G                                       C     
She said: "I have whiskeys and wines on the best!
        G            C             D7      G      
And the words that I told you were only in jest!"
       
chorus
        G                                     C    
I'll go home to my parents, confess what I've done
    G           C            D7       G   
And ask them to pardon their prodigal son
    G                                     C    
And when they've caressed me as oftimes before
  G          C             D7       G     
I never will play the wild rover no more.

A                                                          E                
I think I'm so educated and I'm so civilized 'cause I'm a strict vegetarian
             A                                                    E                 
But with the over-population and inflation and starvation and the crazy politicians
D                                        
I don't feel safe in this world no more,
A                                     
I don't want to die in a nuclear war.
                                           D            E   A    
I want to sail away to a distant shore and make like an ape man.
 CHORUS
A                                            E      
I'm an apeman, I'm an ape, apeman, oh I'm an apeman
       A                                        E      
I'm a King Kong man, I'm a voodo man, oh I'm an apeman
        D                                       
Cause compared to the sun that sits in the sky,
A                                       
Compared to the clouds as they roll by,
                                               D       E   A    
Compared to the bugs and the spiders and flies I am an ape-man.
                                                                       
In man's evolution he's created the city and the motor traffic rumble.
                                                                                     
But give me half a chance and I'd be taking off my clothes and living in the jungle.
                                        
Cause the only time that I feel at ease
                                              
Is swinging up and down in the coconut trees.
                                               
Oh what a life of luxury to be like an apeman.
 CHORUS
 BRIDGE
                D                    A    
Oh come on and love me, be my apeman girl
                D                  A      
And we'll be so happy in my apeman world.
                                                    
I'm an apeman, I'm an ape, apeman, oh I'm an apeman
                                                       
I'm a King Kong man, I'm a voodo man, oh I'm an apeman
                                        
I'll be your Tarzan, you'll be my Jane,
                                            
I'll keep you warm and you'll keep me sane,
                                                                     
We'll sit in the trees and eat bananas all day, just like an apeman.



Sound of silence

Simon and Garfunkel


Am                     G       
Hello darkness, my old friend,
                           Am     
I've come to talk with you again,
                     F       C    
Because a vision softly creeping,
                        F       C     
Left it's seeds while I was sleeping,
        F                             C     
And the vision that was planted in my brain
        Am    
Still remains
           G        Am       
Within the sound of silence.
                             G    
In restless dreams I walked alone
                        Am     
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
                   F        C     
'neath the halo of a street lamp,
                          F        C    
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
        F                                        C     
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
               Am    
That split the night
                G        Am       
And touched the sound of silence.
                         G   
And in the naked light I saw
                           Am    
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
                   F       C     
People talking without speaking,
                   F        C     
People hearing without listening,
               F                       C     
People writing songs that voices never share
           Am   
And no one dare
            G        Am       
Disturb the sound of silence.
                         G    
Fools said i, you do not know
                      Am     
Silence like a cancer grows.
                     F           C    
Hear my words that I might teach you,
                    F           C    
Take my arms that I might reach you.
       F                           C     
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
           
And echoed
       G        Am      
In the wells of silence
                         G      
And the people bowed and prayed
                     Am    
To the neon God they made.
                         F       C     
And the sign flashed out it's warning,
                      F     C     
In the words that it was forming.
                       F                     
And the sign said, the words of the prophets
    Am                    C     
Are written on the subway walls
             C      
And tenement halls.
                     G         Am       
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.

Hey there, Georgy girl,
C                 Em        F     G     
Swinging down the street so fancy free,

Nobody you meet could ever see
        Bb              G7          
The loneliness there -- inside you.

Hey there, Georgy girl,

Why do all the boys just pass you by?

Could it be you just don't try,
Bb           G7sus4      G7    
Or is it the clothes you wear?
Am            Em                   F                 C    
You're always window shopping, but never stopping to buy;
E             A     D            G        G7          
So shed those dowdy feathers and fly -- a little bit.

Hey there, Georgy girl,

It's time for jumping down from the shelf -- a little bit.

   Am7     Cdim                   GM7   G6 
Footsteps  that you hear down the hall, 
    Gm7   Edim              FM7         Dm6 
The laugh that floats on a summer night 
             Bm7-5  E7     AM7   A6  Edim    
That you can never quite recall. And you see
Bm7    Fdim                 AM7             A6 
Laura  on the train that is passing through;
       Am7  Cdim                    GM7  G6 
Those eyes . . . how familiar they seem. 
     Gm7 Edim            Bm7      D+5   
She gave your very first kiss to you --
               E7-9                    Edim A7 D 
That was Laura,but she's only a dream.

Walkin' My Baby Back Home

Words &amp; Music by Roy Turk &amp; Fred Ahlert, 1930


 Recorded by Nat 'King' Cole, 1952* (#8) (Preferred version by Maurice Chevalier)
A          A6         C#m7       F#m  
Gee, it's great after bein' out late
Amaj7      F#m       F#7   
Walkin' my baby back home;
Bm7-5    E7      Bm7-5       E7    
Arm   in arm over meadow and farm,
Bm7-5      E7         A   Edim  E7 
Walkin' my baby back home.      
A       A6      C#m7      F#m   
We go along harmonizing a song,
Amaj7    F#m       F#7  
Or I'm recitin' a poem
Bm7-5   E7          Bm7-5       E7  
Owls go by and they give me the eye
Bm7-5      E7         A   Amaj7 
Walkin' my baby back home.
        
Bridge:
   C#m                    F#7             
We stop for a while, she gives me a smile
    F#m                      G#7   
And snuggles her head on my chest;
    C#m                 F#7              
We start in to pet and that's when I get
Bm7             E7           
Her talcum all over my vest.
A     A6       C#m7         F#m  
After I kinda straighten my tie,
Amaj7      F#m       F#7   
She has to borrow my comb;
Bm7-5     E7      Bm7-5   E7   
One kiss then I continue again
Bm7-5       E7        A     Amaj7 
Walkin' my baby back home.  
                                   
(Instrumental Interlude - 1 Verse)
          
Bridge 2:
       C#m                 F#7             
She's 'fraid of the dark so I have to park
   F#m                        G#7   
Outside of her door till it's light
    C#m              F#7                 
She says if I try to kiss her she'll cry
B7              E7                    
I dry her tears all through the night
A        A6       C#m7      F#m   
Hand in hand to a barbecue stand,
Amaj7           F#m       F#7   
Right from her doorway we roam;
Bm7-5    E7          Bm7-5      E7   
Eats and then it's a pleasure again,
Bm7-5       E7  C#m7-5      F#7   
Walkin' my baby, talkin' my baby,
Bm7-5      E7  C#m7-5        F#7    
Lovin' my baby, I don't mean maybe,
Bm7-5      E7   D9    A   
Walkin' my baby back home

Mele Kalikimaka

R. Alex Anderson               


G                                   
Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say
     G                         D7  
On a bright Hawaiian Christmas Day
                                               
That's the island greeting that we send to you
                               G    
From the land where palm trees sway
                  G7                C                
Here we know that Christmas will be green and bright
    A7                              D7             
The sun to shine by day and all the stars at night
G                           E7  
Mele Kalikimaka is Hawaii's way
   A7            D7        G     
To say "Merry Christmas to you."
                                                       
Som ni m�rker g�r klippet nedan i F. Ett tonsteg ned -

 I pulled into Nazareth, was feelin' 'bout half past dead
A                     C#m              D       A  
 I just needed some place where I can lay my head
A                      C#m             D                A    
 "Hey mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed?"
A                       C#m           D              A   
 He just grinned and shook my hand, "No" was all he said

A         C#m     D      A       C#m       D  
 Take a load off Fanny, take a load for free

You put the load, put the load right on me     
                                                        
I picked up my bags, I went lookin' for a place to hide
                                                     
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walkin' side by side
                                                
I said "Hey Carmen, come on let's go down town"

Take a load off Fanny�

It's just old Luke, and Luke's waitin' on the judgement day
                                                    
"Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?"

Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog
                                                        
He said "I'll fix your rack if you'll take Jack my dog"
                                                            
I said "Wait a minute Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man"
                                                           
He said "That's okay boy, won't you feed him when you can"
      
Refr.
                       
Take a load off Fanny�
                                                
Catch a cannonball now to take me down the line
                                                  
My bag is sinking low, and I do believe it's time
                                                       
To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one
                                               
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone

       A                       B          E         
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
      A                          B           E       
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways
       A                       B         E      
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
           A                   E              
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
           A                        B            E       
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
            E                 B           E               A    
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
         E       B             E   A  E 
It's a hard rain that's gonna fall    
                                        
Oh, what did you see, my blue eyed son?
                                            
Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?
                                                    
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
                                              
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
                                                   
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'
                                                       
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a bleedin'
                                            
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
                                                         
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
                                                           
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
                                                           
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
                                    
And it's a hard rain's a gonna fall
                                         
And what did you hear, my blue eyed son?
                                             
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
                                                        
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin'
                                                          
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
                                                      
Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a blazin'
                                                   
Heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'
                                                      
Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'
                                                
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
                                                  
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
                                                           
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
                                    
And it's a hard rain's a gonna fall
                                        
Oh, who did you meet, my blue eyed son?
                                        
Who did you meet, my darling young one?
                                       
I met a young child beside a dead pony
                                         
I met a white man who walked a black dog
                                           
I met a young woman whose body was burning
                                          
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
                                      
I met one man who was wounded in love
                                              
I met another man who was wounded with hatred
                                                       
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
                                
It's a hard rain's a gonna fall
                                          
Oh, what'll you do now, my blue eyed son?
                                              
Oh, what'll you do now, my darling young one?
                                                     
I'm a goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a fallin'
                                                    
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest
                                                        
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
                                                      
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
                                                         
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
                                                   
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden
                                                
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
                                                   
Where black is the color, where none is the number
                                                          
And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it
                                                         
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it
                                                   
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'
                                                  
But I'll know my song well before I start singin'
                                                       
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
                                
It's a hard rain's a gonna fall

 Who bring their 'ukes' along
G                                    
 And in the glimmer of the moonlight
             A7         D7    
They love to  sing this  song

To  sing  to  When it's cool and  shady

 Where the tricky  Wicki Wackies  woo

Fond mem'rys cling to  me by  moonlight

Although I'm  far  a way

 Someday I'm going where eyes are glowing

Hotel California



Bm                        F#                   
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
A                      E                      
Warm smell of colitas, rising through the air
G                         D                       
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimering light
Em                                        F#                          
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim, I had to stop for the night
Bm                              F#                       
There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell
A                                           E                            
And I was thinking to myself: this could be heaven or this could be hell
G                        D                         
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
Em                                   F#                          
There were voices down the corridor; I thought I heard them say:
 G                           D   
"Welcome to the Hotel California
F#                                                Bm          
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
G                                  D   
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
    Em                                       F#            
Any time of year (any time of year), you can find it here"
Bm                           F#                        
Her mind is Tiffany twisted, she got the Mercedes Benz
A                                     E                      
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
G                                D                  
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Em                      F#                   
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
Bm                           F#                                
So I called up the captain, "Please bring me my wine", He said
A                                      E                    
"We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine"
G                                       D        
And still those voices are calling from far away
Em                                      F#                     
Wake you up in the middle of the night, just to hear them say:
 G                           D   
"Welcome to the Hotel California
F#                                                Bm          
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
     G                                D   
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
       Em                                               F#      
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis"
Bm                      F#                                      
Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice, and she said
 A                               E                  
"We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"
G                             D                           
And in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
Em                                             F#                        
They stab it with their steely knives but they just can't kill the beast
Bm                           F#                   
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
A                                     E                  
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
 G                                   D                     
"Relax," said the night man, "We are programmed to receive
Em                                       F#                   
You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave"

You can't hurry love 

Phil Collins


       G                   C            G 
I need love, love, to ease my mind,     
  Bm         Em            Am                   D               
I need to find, find,      someone to call mine. But mama said:
         G               C                 G     
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait.
 Bm                     Em   Am                   D           
She said, love don't come easy, it's a game of give and take.
  G                 C                 G          
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait,
   Bm   Em                   Am              D               
you got to trust, give it time, no matter how long it takes.
        Bm                            
But how many heartaches must I stand,
          Em                               
before I find a love to let me live again.
                Am                                 
Right now the only thing that keeps me hangin' on,
   D                                       D7    
when I feel my strength, yeah, it's almost gone.
                          
I remember, (mama said) :
         G                C                 G    
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait.
 Bm                     Em  Am                   D            
She said, love don't come easy, it's a game of give and take.
G                        C             G        
How long must I wait, how much more can I take,
 Bm    Em         Am                      D            
before loneliness will cause my heart, heart to break?
     Bm                                 
No, I can't bear to live my life alone,
     Em                                     
I grow impatient for a love to call my own.
        Am                             
But when I feel that I, I can't go on,
D                         D7                                    
these precious words keep me hanging on.I remember,(mama said):
 G                      C                  G     
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait.
   Bm                    Em   Am                   D          
She said, love don't come easy, it's a game of give and take.
  G                      C                 G     
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait.
  Bm   Em                    Am       D            G       
She said trust, give it time, no matter how long it takes.
G               C     G          
No, love, love, don't come easy,
   Bm       Em          Am   D      
but I keep on waiting, anticipating
 G                             C        G    
for that soft voice, to talk to me at night,
   Bm      Em          Am         D     
for some tender arms, to hold me tight.
     G                C        G   
I keep waiting, I keep on waiting,
    Bm      Em           Am             D                 
But it ain't easy,         it ain't easy. But mama said :
 G                 C                 G           
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait.
  Bm             Em         Am              D              
She said trust, give it time, no matter how long it takes.
 G                 C                 G           
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait.
   Bm                     Em   Am                   D           
She said, love don't come easy, it's a game of give and take...

Is your mouth a little weak?

D                                
Hang down your head, Tom Dooley,
                        A7   
hang down your head and cry.
                                 
Hang down your head, Tom Dooley,
                          D    
poor boy, you're bound to die.
D                          
I met her on the mountain,
                 A7    
there I took her life.
                         
Met her on the mountain,
                    D      
Stabbed her with my knife.
D                   
This time tomorrow,
                  A7  
reckon where I'll be.
                           
Hadn't a-been for Grayson,
                     D   
I'd a-been in Tennessee.
D                                
Hang down your head, Tom Dooley,

As Time Goes By

Words &amp; Music by Herman Hupfield, 1931


                                                         
Recorded by Dooley Wilson (as Sam) in "Casablanca," 1942
     Dm7            G7   Gm6             G7    
You must remember this,a kiss is still a kiss.
C                 Dm7    Cdim  Em 
A sigh is just a sigh;         
      D7               G7     
The fundamental things apply,
   Dm7   G7   C      Edim   Dm7   G7 
As time goes by.                  
	Dm7            G7   	  Gm6            G7           
And when two lovers woo, they still say I love you,
   C              Dm7   Cdim   Em 
On that you can rely;          
     D7                  G7      
No matter what the future brings
   Dm7  G7    C     Fdim  C   C7 
As time goes by               
        
Bridge:
      F                  A7                 
Moonlight and love songs never out of date,
Dm                      Cdim              
Hearts full of passion jealousy and hate,
Am          Am+7     Am7                D7   
Woman needs man, and man must have his mate,
    G7     Gdim  G7   
That no one can deny.
     Dm7                G7       Gm6                G7     
It's still the same old story, a fight for love and glory,
C               Dm7    Cdim   Em 
A case of do or die,          
     D7                       G7     
The world will always welcome lovers
   Dm7   G7  C      Fdim    C

I've seen trouble on my days
E                     A        
I bid farewell to old Kentucky
                B      A        E     
The place where I was born and raised

For six long years, I've been in trouble
             B       A       E   
No pleasure here on earth I find
E                               A      
For in this world, I'm bound to ramble
            B         A       E  
I have no friends to help me now

Oh, I'm bound to ride that northern railroad
              B    A         E   
Perhaps I'll die upon this train

Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
               B      A      E   
My face you'll never see no more
E                                A     
But there is one promise that is given
              B        A       E    
I'll meet you on God's golden shore

Blue Christmas

I'll have a blue Christmas without you
           B7                  E        
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
     E         E7        A                    
Decorations of red, on a green Christmas tree
F#7                        B7                       
won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me.
               E                      B7       
And when those blue snow flakes start falling,

that's when those blue memories start calling,

you'll be doing alright, with your Christmas of white,

Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
        D                G               A         
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
G          A               D             G   
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
       D             G                 A         D    
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you.
G                 A               D                 G    
Though i know the evenings empire has returned into sand
D                G    
Vanished from my hand
        D               G         Em        A        
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping
   G         A             D             G    
My weeriness amazes me, im branded on my feet
D                G    
I have no one to meet
        D             G           Em       A        
And the ancient empty streets too dead for dreaming
       
CHORUS
G            A              D              G    
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship
   D                G          D                   G      
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip
   D                G          D                G     
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
      A         
To be wanderin'
G              A           D            G    
Im ready to go anywhere im ready for to fade
  D           G               D                G   
Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way
Em              A        
I promise to go under it
       
CHORUS
     G             A                  D                 G    
Then take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
         D              G         D               G      
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
D                       G          D            G     
Ther haunted frightened trees, out to the windy beach
    D                G        Em    A      
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
        G                 A                D               G    
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
      D            G            D             G     
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
         D          G            D                G      
With all memory and fate, driven deep beneath the waves,
           D          Em         A       
Let me forget about today until tommorow

While My Guitar Gently Weeps
George Harriso


  Am          G           F#                F        
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
Am          G          D          E7 
While my guitar gently weeps      
  Am           G           F#           F        
I look  at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Am          G          C           E7 
Still my guitar gently weeps       
A            C#m F#m     C#m       Bm                 E7     E7 
I don't know why  nobody told you  how to unfold your love   
A            C#m F#m           C#m        Bm                   E7     E7 
I don't know how  someone controlled you, they bought and sold you    
                                              
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
                             
While my guitar gently weeps
                                              
With every mistake we must surely be learning
                             
Still my guitar gently weeps
                                                           
I don't know how you were diverted, you were perverted too
                                                        
I don't know how you were inverted, no one alerted you.
  Am          G           F#                F        
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
Am          G          D          E7 
While my guitar gently weeps      
Am            G           F#                F 
..Look at you all                           
Am          G          D          E7 
Still my guitar gently weeps      



Margaritaville

by Jimmy Buffett


D                                              
Nibblin' on sponge cake, watchin' the sun bake
                                   A    
All of those tourists covered with  oil
                                                 
Strummin' my six-string, On my front porch swing
                                         D     
Smell those shrimp, they're beginnin' to  boil
G          A                   D          
 Wastin' a  way again in Marga  ritaville
G                 A               D     
 Searching for my  lost shaker of  salt
G            A                     D   A       G      
 Some people  claim that there's a  wo  man to  blame
      A     G              D      
But I  know  it's nobody's  fault
D                                               
 I don't know the reason I stay here all season
                                       A    
Nothin' is sure but this brand new tat  too
                                        
But it's a real beauty, a Mexican cutie
                            D     
How it got here I haven't a  clue
G          A                   D          
 Wastin' a  way again in Marga  ritaville
G                 A               D     
 Searching for my  lost shaker of  salt
G            A                     D   A       G      
 Some people  claim that there's a  wo  man to  blame
      A       G                     D      
Now I  think,  hell, it could be my  fault
D                                             
I blew out my flip-flop, stepped on a pop-top
                                  A     
Cut my heel had to cruise on back  home
                                                          
But there's booze in the blender, and soon it will render
                                          D   
That frozen concoction that helps me hang  on
G          A                   D          
 Wastin' a  way again in Marga  ritaville
G                 A               D     
 Searching for my  lost shaker of  salt

 Some people  claim that there's a  wo  man to  blame

But I  know  it's my own damned  fault

  C                          D7                        
I  bought a new computer, It  cost two thousand pound;
G                                                  C     
But every time I switch it on  It keeps on falling down.
C                   C7             
I used to think it   was my friend
F                 D7              
Now it drives me  round the bend;
       C                 A7           
You'd  be surprised the  time I spend
G#7           C         
Reinstalling   Windows.
C               C7            
I switch it on; what is this?
F                    D7          
Something wrong with config.sys;
     C         A7            
This isn't my idea of bliss,
G#7           C

E7                               A7                         
I want to share my printers and   I want to share my files,
D7                            G                     G7     
I want to share my anger 'cos It drives me blinkin' wild .
C                C7           
Load disk four,  oh what fun!
    F                  D7               
It  says it helps you  get things done;
  C           A7         
Every day now everyone's
G#7           C         
Reinstalling   Windows.
C               C7          
 Load disk ten; it will say

All you  do is plug and play
     C           A7        
Why  do I spend  every day
G#7           C         
Reinstalling   Windows?
C                                   F              
It can't find my printer It can't locate my mouse;
          F      A7           
The other day it told me that
     C               A7        
They were in some other house.
C                C7              
Still unplugged, still unplayed,
         F      D7            
E-mailed God in search of aid
     C            A7         
He's far too busy I'm afraid

Does it work? Can pigs fly?

Ring of Fire

Johnny Cash


A         D       A     
Love is a burning thing
               D     A    
And it makes a fiery ring
         D      A    
Bound by wild desire
              D       A    
I fell into a ring of fire
E              D               A    
I fell in to a burning ring of fire
       E                
I went down, down, down
        D           A      
And the flames went higher
       A                   
And it burns, burns, burns
    D       A    
The ring of fire
    D       A    
The ring of fire
A            D       A     
The taste of love is sweet
                 D    A    
When hearts like ours meet
               D      A     
I fell for you like a child
           D         A    
Oh but the fire went wild
E              D               A    
I fell in to a burning ring of fire
       E                
I went down, down, down
        D           A      
And the flames went higher
       A                   
And it burns, burns, burns
    D       A    
The ring of fire
    D       A    
The ring of fire
A                          
And it burns, burns, burns
    D       A    
The ring of fire
    D       A    
The ring of fire

Mr. Fancy Pants

Jonathan Coulton


E                                                   
Chances are your pants are not as fancy as the pair
   F#m                       B                     
Of very fancy pants that Mr. Fancy Pants will wear
                                              
E                                 E/D     C#7
                                                    
When everybody�s marching in the fancy pants parade
     F#m            B    
He�s gonna pass the test
     F#m          B    
He�s gonna be the best
    F#m     B        E    B7 
The best in terms of pants
E                                                 
You look in every catalog you shop at every store
      F#m                            B                        
Cause even though you have a hundred pants you want some more
                                                    
E                                          E/D  C#7
                                                          
When suddenly you see the greatest pants you�ve ever seen
    F#m             B    
And even though you know
           F#m           B     
It�s gonna cost a lot of dough
    F#m              B            E    B7 E 
You have to have the world�s best pants   
                                              
A            Bdim/A         A          Bdim/A
                                        
Say a little prayer for Mr. Fancy Pants
    Dm(maj7)    Dm6   
The whole world knows
     Dm(maj7) Dm6     
It�s only     clothes
    Cmaj7  C    
And deep inside
     Esus4/B B7 
He�s sad     
     E                                                    
They make the big announcement and the trophy goes to you
    F#m                                  B                      
You thought you had some fancy pants and now you know it�s true
                                                
E                                    E/D    C#7
                                                     
You look at Mr. Fancy Pants and hold the trophy high
F#m       B      
Everybody cheers
           F#m               B     
While he�s blinking back the tears

Moonglow

Words &amp; Music by Will Hudson, Eddie De Lange &amp; Irving Miller, 1934


Featured in the movie Picnic, 1956
Medley version (with "The Theme From Picnic") by Nelson Riddle Orchestra, 1956

    Am7           Cm       
It must have been moonglow
G              A9   
Way up in the blue;
    Am             Cdim    
It must have been moonglow
 G   Bbm7-5    Am7         G   
That  led  me straight to you.
    Am7           Cm     
I still hear you saying,
       G            A9    
"Dear One, hold me fast,"
    Am         Cdim     
And I start in praying,
     G   Bbm7-5  Am7        G    
"Oh Lord, please let this last."
        
Bridge:
            G+7 G/F#     
We(G) seemed    to float
              E7-9 E7   
right through  the air;
    A9                   Am7              D9     D+ 
Heavenly songs seemed to come from ev'rywhere.   
     Am7              Cm      
And now when there's moonglow
     G         A9   
Way up in the blue,
  Am         Cdim       
I always re - mem - ber
 G   Bbm7-5    Am7     G   
That moonglow gave me you.
      
Coda:
G    Bbm7-5   Am7 Am7-5  G   
That moonglow gave  me  you.



Its all over now, baby blue

Text &amp; musik: Bob Dylan 


        D  Dsus4 
Intro: 	 - 
 A                   G                        D             
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last
        A                 G                 D          
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
 Em                G                D  
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
  Em           G           D  
Crying like a fire in the sun
F#7           G                   A    
Look out the saints are coming through
    Em             G          D   
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
                                                    
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense.
                                              
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
                                           
The empty-handed painter from your streets
                                          
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets.
                                    
This sky, too, is folding under you
                                  
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
                                                
All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home.
                                                  
Your empty handed armies, they're all going home.
                                        
The lover who just walked out your door
                                           
Has taken all his blankets from the floor.
                                     
The carpet, too, is moving under you
                                  
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
                                                            
Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you.
                                                       
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you.
                                        
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
                                               
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
                                    
Strike another match, go start anew
                                  
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.



I Shot the Sheriff

Bob Marley


Bm                 Em                       Bm     
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy
Bm                 Em                      Bm      
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy
Em     F#m        Bm       
All around in my home town
Em               F#m        Bm  
They're trying to track me down
  Em                F#m            Bm    
They say they want to bring me in guilty
       Em           F#m    Bm 
For the killing of a deputy
       Em        F#m    Bm          
For the life of a deputy But I say?
Bm                 Em                      Bm          
I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense
Bm                 Em                      Bm            
I shot the sheriff, and they say it is a capital offense
Em      F#m         Bm             
Sheriff John Brown always hated me
Em     F#m        Bm  
For what I don't know
Em     F#m         Bm          
Every time that I plant a seed
  Em             F#m        Bm    
He said "Kill it before it grows"
  Em             F#m        Bm           
He said "Kill it before it grows" I say!
Bm                 Em                      Bm          
I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense
Bm                 Em                      Bm          
I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense
Em      F#m        Bm       
Freedom came my way one day
Em      F#m          Bm        
And I started out of town yeah
Em        F#m          Bm                
All of a sudden I see sheriff John Brown
Em         F#m      Bm  
Aiming to shoot me down
   Em   F#m   Bm                  
So I shot, I shot him down I say!
Bm                 Em                       Bm     
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy
Bm                 Em                       Bm    
I shot the sheriff, but I didn't shoot the deputy
Em     F#m        Bm          
Reflexes got the better of me
Em     F#m        Bm      
And what is to be must be
Em     F#m            Bm               
Every day the bucket falls to the well
Em              F#m         Bm       
But one day the bottom will drop out
Em        F#m               Bm                  
Yes, one day the bottom will drop out But I say
Bm                 Em                       Bm            
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy, oh no
Bm                 Em                       Bm           
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot no deputy, oh no
Em F#m Bm

Good Company

by Queen


C7                                F                    
Take good care of what you've got my father said to me
C7                                   F                   
As he puffed his pipe and Baby B. he dandled on his knee
F               F7           Bb    Db7      C7            F  
Don't fool with fools who'll turn away keep all Good Company
   C7     F   
Oo Hoo Oo Hoo
     F7                Bb        Db7     C7             F  
Take care of those you call your own and keep Good Company
C7                           F                        
Soon I grew and happy too my very good friends and me
C7                                  F                     
We'd play all day with Sally J. the girl from number four
     F7       Bb       Db7       C7           F  
Very soon I begged her won't you keep me Company

 D7                            Gm   
Now marriage is an institution sure
    C               F                D7   
My wife and I, our needs and nothing more
       Gm                                      
All my friends by a year by and by disappeared
           Bbm                    A    
But we're safe enough behind our door.
  C7                               F               
I flourished in my humble trade my reputation grew
    C7                                F                        
The work devoured my waking hours but when my time was through
    F7           Bb      Db7    C7           F  
Reward of all my efforts my own Limited Company
   C7     F   
Oo Hoo Oo Hoo
  F7             Bb    Db7   C7          F  
I hardly noticed Sally as we parted Company
Gm                                          
All through the years in the end it appears
           Bb                     A  
There was never really anyone but me
C7                           F                       
Now I'm old I puff my pipe But no-one's there to see
C7                           F               
I ponder on the lesson of my life's insanity
     F7                Bb        Db7     C7             F  
Take care of those you call your own and keep Good Company

Fairytale
Alexander Rybak


                       
Intro: Dm Bb C  Bb  Am
Dm                    Gm      
Years ago, when I was younger
  Bb                    Am  
I kinda liked a girl I knew
Dm                       Gm          
She was mine and we were sweethearts
Bb                           Am  
That was then but then it's true
  Dm                Gm          Bb            Am   
I'm in love with a fairytale, even though it hurts
       Dm                Gm          
Cause I don't care if I lose my mind
Bb          Am     
I'm already cursed
Dm                    Gm 
                      
                            
Every day we start fighting
  Bb                    Am  
Every night we fell in love
Dm                    Gm         
No one else could make me sadder
   Bb                    Am              
But no one else could lift me high above
Dm                    Gm      
I don't know what I was doing
  Bb                    Am  
When suddenly we fell apart
Dm                    Gm   
Nowadays I cannot find her
  Bb                    Am                 
But when I do, we'll get a brand new start
  Dm                Gm          Bb            Am   
I'm in love with a fairytale, even though it hurts
       Dm                Gm          
Cause I don't care if I lose my mind
Bb          Am     
I'm already cursed



I'VE JUST SEEN A FACE 

Lennon/McCartney


G                     
I've just seen a face
                                 
I can't forget the time or place
      G       Em  
Where we just met
                           
She's just the girl for me
                                      C   
And I want all the world to see we've met
      D        G  
Yi yi yi yi yi yi
G                       
Had it been another day
                              G   
I might have looked the other way
    Em                        
And I'd have never been aware
                                 C     
But as it is I'll dream of her tonight
      D        G  
Yi yi yi yi yi yi
        
CHORUS:
D                 C       
Falling, yes I am falling
              G          C     G    
And she keeps calling me back again
D                 C       
Falling, yes I am falling
              G          C     G    
And she keeps calling me back again
G                                    
I have never known the likes of this
                
I've been alone
    G      Em                                  
And I have missed things and kept out of sight
                                      C

 D                    
Just about a year ago
   G              D   
I set out on the road
 D                   Bm     
Seekin' my fame and fortune
      Em                  A   
And lookin' for a pot of gold
  D                   Bm             
Things got bad, and things got worse
    G                 D   
I guess you know the tune
 D          A             G   D 
Oh, Lord, stuck in Lodi again 
   D                      
I rode in on a Greyhound,
         G                D  
I'll be walkin' out if I go
D                      Bm   
 I was just passin' through
         Em              A   
Must be seven months or more
 D                   Bm   
Ran out of time and money
 G                        D     
Looks like they took my friends
 D          A             G   D 
Oh, Lord, stuck in Lodi again 
     D                    
The man from the magazine
     G            D  
Said I was on my way
 D                   Bm     
Somewhere I lost connection
 Em                   A  
Ran out of songs to play
   D                  Bm              
I came into town on a one-night stand
 G                          D    
Looks like my plans fell through
 D          A             G   D 
Oh, Lord, stuck in Lodi again 
D                      
If I only had a dollar
    G                D   
For every song I've sung
    D                Bm         
And every time I've had to play
       Em                A   
While people sat there drunk
      D                       Bm  
You know I'd catch the next train
 G               D   
Back to where I live
 D          A             G   D 
Oh, Lord, stuck in Lodi again 
 D          A             G   D 
Oh, Lord, stuck in Lodi again

Please allow me to introduce myself
      A                 E     
I'm a man of wealth and taste
                       D               
I've been around for a long, long year
       A                     E     
Stolen many a man's soul and faith
                                                           E    
I was around when Jesus Christ had His moment of doubt and pain
                                                           E    
Made damn sure that Pilate washed his hands and sealed his fate
B                    A                 E    
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name

But what's puzzling you, is the nature of my game
E                  D          
I stuck around St. Petersburg
       A                     E      
When I saw it was time for a change
                          D         
I killed the Tzar and his ministers
    A                 E    
Anastasia screamed in vain
                      D              
I rode a tank, held a gen'ral's rank
         A                        E            
When the blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank
B                    A                 E    
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
           D                    A            E    
But what's puzzling you, is the nature of my game
E                              D                
I watched with glee while your kings and queens
           A                   E              
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
                              D          
I shouted out "Who killed the Kennedys?"
     A                E          
When after all it was you and me
                               
Let me please introduce myself
                         E     
I am a man of wealth and taste
                    D           
And I lay traps for troubadours
        A                           E   
Who get killed before they reach Bombay
B                    A                 E    
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name

But what's confusing you, is just the nature of my game
E                      D        
Just as every cop is a criminal
    A               E      
And all the sinners saints
                                D       
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
              A              E       
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
                             D        
So if you meet me, have some courtesy
          A                 E     
Have some sympathy and some taste
                                    
Use all your well-learned politesse
        A                E     
Or I'll lay your soul to waste
B                    A                 E    
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name

             Bm7 A#m7 Bm7             Bm7 A#m7 Bm7  
If I didn't care more than words can say
             E7                     Gm  
If I didn't care would I feel this way?

If this isn't love then why do I thrill?

And what makes my head go 'round and 'round
          A     Bb     A     
While my heart stands still?
             Bm7 A#m7 Bm7         Bm7 A#m7 Bm7

Would all this be true if I didn't care for you?

Waltzing Matilda
 Mel:Australian trad./Lyrics:Henry Lawso


D            A       Bm          G          
Once a jolly swagman camped by a Billabong.
D                    A7            
Under the shade of a Coolabah tree
       D          F#7     Bm              G            
And he sang as he sat and waited till his billy boiled
D                         A7         D    
"You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me."
       
Corus:
D                 G                 
Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda,
D                                    A7  
"You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me"
       D          F#7     Bm              G            
And he sang as he sat and waited till his billy boiled
D                         A7         D    
"You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me."
                                               
Down come a jumbuck to drink at the water hole
                                            
Up jumped a swagman and grabbed him in glee
                                                    
And he sang as he stowed him away in his tucker bag
                                           
"You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me'".
                                               
Up rode the Squatter a riding his thoroughbred
                                      
Up rode the Trooper - one, two, three
                                                       
"Where's that jumbuck you've got in your tucker bag?",
                                          
"You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me".
                                                   
But the swagman he up and jumped in the water hole
                                       
Drowning himself by the Coolabah tree,
                                                         
And his ghost may be heard as it sings in the Billabong,
                                          
"Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?"

Gonna make that lady mine
                                
When she signs that dotted line

Knocking on heavens door

Bob Dylan


A    E                   Bm  A       E          D    
Mama take this badge off me, i can't use it anymore.
A           E                  Bm   
Its getting dark, too dark too see.
A             E                   D     
Feels like in knocking on heavens door.
A             E                   Bm    
Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door.
A             E                   D     
Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door.
A    E                  Bm      
Mama put my guns in the ground,
A       E              D    
i can't shoot them anymore.
A               E               Bm    
That long black cloud is coming down,

Feels like in knocking on heavens door.
A             E                   Bm    
Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door.
A             E                   D     
Knock, knock, knocking on heavens door.



I Wanna Be Like You

Richard M. Sherman &amp; Robert B. Sherman

Now I'm the king of the swingers

Oh, the jungle VIP,
                                     
I've reached the top and had to stop
                          Bm  
And that's what botherin' me.
                          
I wanna be a man, mancub,
                      F#7  
And stroll right into town
                               
And be just like the other men
                        Bm     
I'm tired of monkeyin' around!

Can learn to be human too.

Now don't try to kid me, mancub
                   F#7  
I made a deal with you
                                
What I desire is man's red fire
                      Bm    
To make my dream come true.
                            
Give me the secret, mancub,
                F#7  
Clue me what to do
                                      
Give me the power of man's red flower
                 Bm   
So I can be like you.
        
Chorus:
A7  D          
Oh, oo-bee-doo

I wanna walk like you,
A7            D    
Talk like you too.
       A7       D    
You'll see it's true
            B7  
An ape like me
    E7          A7    D    
Can learn to be human too.

Me and Bobby McGee 

Text &amp; musik: Kris Kristofferson. Det finns lite olika versioner av den h�r s�ngen, h�r �r en av dem.


A                                               
Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waitin' for a train
A                            E7   
Feelin' near as faded as my jeans
E7                                                
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
     E7                              A   
And rode us all the way into New Orleans
A                                               
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
        A                 A7              D   
I was playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues
 D                                      A                           
Windshield wipers slappin' time, I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
 E7                              A  A7 
We sang every song that driver knew 
      
Refr.
D                                 A                  
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
     E7                                    A   A7 
And nothing ain't worth nothing but it's free. 
D                                  A                    
Feeling good was easy, lord, when Bobby sang the blues.
 E7                                 
Feelin' good was good enough for me
E7                                 A  
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee
                                                       
From the old Kentucky coal mines to the California sun
                                    
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
                                                         
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
                                   
Bobby, baby, kept me from the cold
                                                 
But one day up near Salinas, I let her slip away
                                                      
She was lookin' for that home and I hope she finds it
                                                         
Well I'd trade all my tomorrows for one single yesterday
                                        
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
      
Refr.
                                                     
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
                                           
Nothin', and that's all that Bobby left me
                                                             
Well, feelin' good was easy, lord, when Bobby sang the blues
                                        
And feelin' good was good enough for me
                                      
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee

            Cm7-5         Fm7       Bb      Eb   Gdim 
The dearest things I know      are what you are.

One day my happy arms will hold you
    CM7 Cm7        G      Bm7-5      E7

      Am7               D7 Cdim  G    
When all the things you are are mine.

WELL WE KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOIN'
                                    
BUT WE DONT'T KNOW WHERE WE'VE BEEN
                               
AND WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE KNOWIN'
                                 
BUT WE CAN'T SAY WHAT WE'VE SEEN
                              
AND WE'RE NOT LITTLE CHILDREN
                         
AND WE KNOW WHAT WE WANT
                          
AND THE FUTURE IS CERTAIN
                            
GIVE US TIME TO WORK IT OUT

C#m              
 Come on inside,
E                             
 Takin' that ride to nowhere,

 We'll take that ride
A                              E 
 I'm feeling okay this mornin' 
        B     
And you know.
A                              E    
 We're  on  the  road  to  paradise

Here we go, here we go
       
CHORUS
A                          E

I dont't care
A                            E

         B              
And it's very far away,
                            
But it's growing day by day
             C#m                         
And it's all right, baby, it's all right
          B                  
Would you like to come along
                               
You can help me sing this song
             C#m                         
And it's all right, baby, it's all right
         B                   
They can tell you what to do
                               
But they'll make a fool of you
             C#m                         
And it's all right, baby, it's all right

Shine On, Harvest Moon

Words &amp; Music by Jack Norworth &amp; Nora Bayes-Norworth, 1938


Am                   E7                Am          
The night was mighty dark so you could hardly see,
        C               E7     
for the moon refused to shine.
Am             E7             Am     E7    
Couple sittin� underneath the willow tree,
    D7        G7    
for love they pine.
G7                                       
Little maid was kinda scared of darkness
       C                        
so she said, �I guess I�ll go.�
D7           G     D7               G    
Boy began to sigh, looked up to the sky,
A7                D7             G7   
told the moon his little tale of woe.
CHORUS
                            
������������� �������������
   A7                         D7

G7                          C        F         C             
I ain�t had no lovin� since January, February, June or July.
A7                         D7                      
Snow time ain�t no time to stay outdoors and spoon
   G7                         C     
so shine on, shine on harvest moon,
    F         C    
for me and my gal.

Christmas in Hawaii

     D                                       A7                      
When pure white snow falls to the ground and turns to slush next day
    G                           D            A7  
The only thing I think about is how to get away
    D                                 A7                
The freezing and the darkness sink my spirits even more
  G               A7              D    
I wander home and firmly close my door
  G                           B7                
I check my bank account and I surf the internet
   Em                                A7                    
To find a place where only warm blue seas will make me wet
  G               A7               Bm            
I find a group of islands that are very far away
  G               A7             D     
I want to pack my bags and leave today
  D                  A7             D     
I want to spend this Christmas in Hawai�i
                         A7        D    
Where palm trees and the curly koa grow
   D                 A7            D        
Instead I�m still at home oh my oh silly me
    D          F#7            Bm  
But honestly I really want to go
          G                     
Where the hula girls are pretty
        D                    
And the weather isn�t shitty
      F#7                        Bm  
And I can get lei�d every single day
  G                  A7             D   Bm  
I want to spend this Christmas in Hawai�i
G                    A7           D    
And once I get there maybe I will stay
                                                              
At Christmas time you are supposed to feel filled up with joy
                                                              
There�s good will and there�s happiness to every girl and boy
                                                
Why should our feelings be decided by the date?
                                        
I�m out of synch, cause I procrastinate
                                                      
With too much expectation and no freedom for the mind
                                                  
I have an inclination just to leave it all behind
                                                            
And take a plane to where the sun shines from a sky so blue
                                             
Watch out now, �cause I�m gonna come to you.
                                    
I want to spend this Christmas.....

Morning Has Broken

Cat Stevens


D               Em  
Morning has broken,
A              G  D     
Like the first morning,
              F#m Bm  
Blackbird has spoken,
F              A     
Like the first bird.
D              G        
Praise for the singing,
D              Bm  F    
Praise for the morning,
A               D     G    
Praise for them springing,
A7              D     
Fresh from the world.
D G A F# Bm G A D 
              
                             
Sweet's the rain's new fall,
                      
Sunlight from heaven,
                        
Like the first dewfall,
                    
On the first grass.
                          
Praise for the sweetness,
                   
Of the wet garden,
                        
Sprung in completeness,
                     
Where his feet pass.
                      
Mine is the sunlight,
                     
Mine is the morning,
                       
Born of the one light,
               
Eden saw play.
                     
Praise with elation,
                      
Praise every morning,
                  
God's recreation,
                
Of the new day.
                    
Morning has broken,
                        
Like the first morning,
                      
Blackbird has spoken,
                     
Like the first bird.
                       
Praise for the singing
                        
Praise for the morning,
                           
Praise for them springing,
                      
Fresh from the world.

Magnetic Fields - Nothing Matters When We're Dancing




F          C    Bb           
Dance with me my  old friend
                  
once before we go
                                  
Let's pretend this song won't end
                             
and we never have to go home
          Gm                    C     
and we'll dance among the chandeliers
        
Chorus:
F                               Bb     
And nothing matters when we're dancing
C                           F        
 In tat or tatters you're entrancing
                     Bb      
Be we in Paris or in Lansing
C                           F       
 nothing matters when we're dancing
C                           F       
nothing matters when we're dancing.
                                 
You've never been more beautiful
                              
your eyes like two full moons
                                   
as here in this poor old dancehall
                         
among the dreadful tunes
                                   
the awful songs we don't even hear
         
(Chorus)

I RIDE AN  OLD PAINT




C                                      
I ride an old paint, I lead an old dan

I'm goin' to Montan' to throw the hoolihan

      G7                          C                 
Their tails are all matted, their backs are all raw
               
CHORUS: (In C)

Ride around little dogies, ride around them slow

For the fiery and snuffy are rarin' to go

Old Bill Jones had two daughters and a song

One went to Denver, and the other went wrong

His wife, she died in a poolroom fight
    G#7                       C#                 
But still he's a-singin' from mornin' till night
               
CHORUS (In C#)

When I die, take my saddle from the wall

Place it on my old pony, lead him out of his stall
       A7                              D                 
Tie my bones to my saddle and turn our faces to the West

And we'll ride the prairie we love the best

There's a new world somewhere, they call the promised land,
         G        Em          C                D     
And I'll be there someday, if you will hold my hand.
        Em               C           D      C      G   
I still need you there beside me, no matter what I do,
C     G         C     D7           G C G 
For I know I'll never find another you.
         G      C           A7              D7   
There is always someone for each of us they say,
           G     Em         C          D    
And you'll be my someone forever and a day.
        Em                     C       D      C       G       
I could search the whole world over, until my life is through
C     G         C     D7           G C G 
But I know I'll never find another you.
        
Chorus:
D      Em          C           G    C     G     
It's a long, long, journey, so stay by my side.
D      Em               D            C     G      C     D7     
When I walk through the storm you'll be my guide, be my guide,
        G         C           A7                D7     
If they gave me a fortune, my pleasure would be small,
         G             Em          C             D   
I could lose it all tomorrow, and never mind at all.
       Em                 C             D          C        G   
But if I should lose your love, dear, I don't know what I'd do,
C     G         C     D7           G C G 
For I know I'll never find another you.
       
Chorus

As Time Goes By

Words &amp; Music by Herman Hupfield, 1931


                                                         
Recorded by Dooley Wilson (as Sam) in "Casablanca," 1942
     Dm7            G7   Gm6             G7    
You must remember this,a kiss is still a kiss.
C                 Dm7    Cdim  Em 
A sigh is just a sigh;         
      D7               G7     
The fundamental things apply,
   Dm7   G7   C      Edim   Dm7   G7 
As time goes by.                  
Dm7             G7      Gm6            G7           
And when two lovers woo, they still say I love you,
   C              Dm7   Cdim   Em 
On that you can rely;          
     D7                  G7      
No matter what the future brings
   Dm7  G7    C     Fdim  C   C7 
As time goes by               
        
Bridge:
      F                  A7                 
Moonlight and love songs never out of date,
Dm                      Cdim              
Hearts full of passion jealousy and hate,
Am          Am+7     Am7                D7   
Woman needs man, and man must have his mate,
    G7     Gdim  G7   
That no one can deny.
     Dm7                G7       Gm6                G7     
It's still the same old story, a fight for love and glory,
C               Dm7    Cdim   Em 
A case of do or die,          
     D7                       G7     
The world will always welcome lovers
   Dm7   G7  C      Fdim    C 
As time goes by.

Love and hate what a beautiful combination, sending shivers make me quiver

Feel it sliver up and down my spine

November rain

Guns n Roses


F                     Dm   
When I look into your eyes
                    C       
I can see a love restrained
F                  Dm       
But darling when I hold you
                          C    
Don't you know I feel the same
Dm                  G      
Cause nothin' last forever
                            C      
And we both know hearts can change
Dm                      G      
And it's hard to hold a candle
                     C    
In the cold november rain
F                               Dm             
We've been through this such a long, long time
                        C             
Just tryin' to kill the pain, oh yeah
F                                           
But lovers always come and lovers always go
    Dm                                    C     
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today
             
Walkin' away
F                                               
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
Dm                   
I could rest my head
                           C    
Just knowin' that you were mine
         
All mine
Dm                G       
So if you want to love me
                   C       
Then darlin' don't refrain
Dm                  G       
Or I'll just end up walkin'
                     C    
In the cold november rain
F                            G    
Do you need sometime on your own?
       F                 G      
Do you need sometime all alone?
          F                       G   
Everybody needs sometime on their own
                   F                 G     
Don't you know you need sometime all alone
Em          F                C          
I know it's hard to keep and open heart
Em        F                   Dm       
When even friends seem out to harm you
Em         F            C            
But if you could heal a broken heart
Em       F              G         
Wouldn't time be out to charm you
F                               G   
Sometimes I need sometime on my own
            F                 G     
Sometimes I need sometime all alone
          F                       G   
Everybody needs sometime on their own
                   F                 G     
Don't you know you need sometime all alone
F                           
And when your fears subside
Dm                C                
And shadows still remains, oh yeah
F                   Dm      
I know that you can love me
                            C     
When there's no one left to blame
Dm                G        
So never mind the darkness
                    C   
We still can find a way
Dm                  G       
Cause nothin' lasts forever
                   C    
Even cold november rain

I - mag - i - na - tion  is funny;

It makes a cloudy day sunny,   
 Dm     Dm+7         Dm7    
Makes a bee think of honey,
Dm6     Gdim  A7     Fdim   G7 
Just as  I  think of you.   
G7             C       Gdim     Dm7         G7 
I - mag - i - na - tion      is crazy;      
       C       G+           Gdim     A7 
Your whole perspective gets hazy,    
 Dm        Dm+7     Dm7   
Starts you asking a daisy
Dm6     CM7   Am          Gm7   C7 
What to do,       what to do.   
        
Bridge:

Find it's only your i  - mag - i - na - tion again?   Oh, well�

I - mag - i - na - tion       is silly,

You go around willy - nilly,

John Prine &amp; Fred Koller


D                                           
I packed my bags and bought myself a ticket
                              A    
For the land of the tall palm tree
                                D  
Aloha Old Milwaukee, Hello Waikiki
                                      
I just stepped down from the airplane
                           G   
When I thought I heard her say
                     D                   
Waka waka nuka nuka, waka waka nuka nuka
A                D     A   
Would you like a lei?  Eh?
        
Chorus:
D                            
Let's talk dirty in Hawaiian

Whisper in my ear
                                
Kicka poo ka maka wa wah wahini
                        D    
Are the words I long to hear
                            
Lay your coconut on my tiki
                           G    
What the hecka mooka mooka dear
                      D      
Let's talk dirty in Hawaiian
        A               D    
Say the words I long to hear
D                              
It's a ukelele Honolulu sunset
                           A    
Listen to the grass skirts sway
                              
Drinking rum from a pineapple
                D   
Out on Honolulu Bay
                              
The steel guitars all playing
                             G     
While she's talking with her hands
                     D                           
Gimme gimme oka doka make a wish and wanta polka
A            D     A 
Words I understand 
       
Chorus
D                                  
I boughta lota junka with my moola
                              A    
And sent it to the folks back home
                                         
I never had the chance to dance the hula
                      D     
I guess I should have known
                                           
When you start talking to the sweet wahini
                        G     
Walking in the pale moonlight
                      D                           
Oka doka what a setta knocka rocka sis boom bocas

Hope I said it right 
       
Chorus
       
Aloha!

The Am is really an FMaj7 but the Am fingering works so thats how I wrote it.
Also, the Bb can be replaced with a Gm. I suggest you experiment and see what you like.

Poetry in motion

G      C      G     Em             
When I see my baby, what do I see?
G       C         D       
Poetry, poetry in motion.
G         Em      C             D     
Poetry in motion, walking by my side.
    G          Em      C             D          
Her lovely locomotion, keeps my eyes open wide.
G         Em      C              D       G        
Poetry in motion, see her gentle sway, a wave out
       Em           C     D         G    
on the ocean, could never move that way.
        
CHORUS:
G Bm         G                 Bm              G       
I love every movement, there's nothing I would change.
G   Bm             C          
She doesn't need improvement,
      D                  D7       
She's much too nice to rearrange.
G         Em      C                D   
Poetry in motion, dancing close to me,
  G           Em      C       D    G      
A flower of devotion, swaying gracefully.
G     Em                      C     D           
Whoa..whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa,
            G          
whoa, whoa, whoa. (x2)
G         Em      C              D     
Poetry in motion, see her gentle sway.
  G               Em          C     D         G    
A wave out on the ocean could never move that way.
        
CHORUS:
G         Em      C          D      
Poetry in motion, all that I adore.
   G                Em            C       D        G     
No number nine love potion, could make me love her more.

Whoa..whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa (x6)

Misty

Erroll Garner 


 A7        Dmaj7      Am7          Cdim        Gmaj7    G6 
Look at me,   I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree,    
                     Gm             Am   
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud;
  Dmaj7        Bm7         Em7        A7           F#7   B7   E7   A9 
I can't understand, I get misty just holding your hand.            
A7          Dmaj7     Am7      Cdim             Gmaj7   G6 
Walk my way     and a thousand violins begin to play    
                    Gm              Am  
Or it might be the sound of your hello,
     Dmaj7    Bm7         Em7        A7             D    Gdim   D 
That music I hear,  I get misty, the moment you're near.        
        
Bridge:
         Dmaj7          Am         Am      Am7 
You can say that you're leading me on,     
         Cm7         Gmaj7       G6  
But it's just what I want you to do.
                      F#7           E7    
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost?
Bm7             E7          A7   Bm7   Cdim   A7 
That's why I'm fol - lowing you.              
A7        Dmaj7         Am7              Cdim        Gmaj7   G6 
On my own,   would I wander through this wonderland alone,   
                  Gm                 Am   
Never knowing my right foot from my left,
   Dmaj7        Bm7   
My hat from my glove?
        Em7        A7           F7     B7 
I'm too misty and too much in love.

I'm too mist - y and  too  much in love.        



Smile

Charlie Chaplin


  D                                 
Smile, though your heart is aching,
  Dmaj7                           
Smile, even though it's breaking.
  D6             Ddim          Em             B7  
When there are clouds in the sky, you'll get by
         Em                                
If you smile through your fear and sorrow.
  Gm                      
Smile, and maybe tomorrow
  D             Bm                 Em        A   A7 
You'll see the sun come shining through for you. 
 D                                
Light up your face with gladness,
 Dmaj7                       
Hide ev'ry trace of sadness,
 D6          Ddim        Em       B7  
Although a tear may be ever  so near
            Em                           
That's the time you must keep on trying.
  Gm                             
Smile. What's the use of crying?
 D                Bm                  Em  
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
    A7           D    
If you'll just smile.

My Way

Frank Sinatra


    D                    
And now, the end is near
         Am6             B7      
And so I face the final curtain.
    Em                   Em7  
My friend, I'll say it clear
              A7                 D       
I'll state my case of which I'm certain.
                          D7  
I've lived a life that's full
            G               Gm     
I travelled each and every highway
     D                     A7  
And more, much more than this,
         Em  D   
I did it my way.
    D                   
Regrets, I've had a few
           Am6             B7      
But then again too few to mention.
   Em               Em7  
I did what I had to do
              A7              D        
And saw it through, without exemption.
                        D7    
I planned each charted course
               G              Gm   
Each careful step, along the byway
     D                     A7  
And more, much more than this,
         Em  D   
I did it my way.
                                    Am7  
Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew,
           G                          
When I bit off more than I could chew
               Em7                 A7    
But through it all, when there was doubt
         F#m7             Bm  
I ate it up, and spit it out,
           Em7               A7   
I faced it all, And I stood tall,
           Em D    
And did it my way.



The winner takes it all

ABBA


               G                            D            
I don't wanna talk, about the things we've gone through.
                     Am                D  
Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
                    G                             D        
I've played all my cards, and that's what you've done too.
                 Am                   D   
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
                    G    
The winner takes it all,
     B7              Em   
the loser standing small.
   E7            Am  
Beside the victory,
                 D  
that's her destiny.
                                               
I was in your arms, thinking I belonged there,
                                              
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
                                                  
building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there.
                                        
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
                               
The Gods may through the dize,
                            
their minds as cold as ice.
                            
And someone way down there,
                    
loses someone dear.
                         
The winner takes it all,
                       
the loser has to fall.
                            
It's simple and it's plain,
                        
-why should I complain?
                                                    
But tell me does she kiss, like I used to kiss you?
                                                 
Does it feel the same, when she calls your name?
                                                 
Somewhere deep inside, you must know I miss you.
                                          
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
                        
The judges will decide,
                       
the likes of me abide.
                        
Spectators of the show,
                    
always staying low.
                      
The game is on again,
                     
a lover or a friend.
                        
A big thing or a small,
                         
the winner takes it all.
                                              
I don't wanna talk, if it makes you feel sad.
                                                
and I understand, you've come to shake my hand.
                                       
I apologize, if it makes you fell sad,
                                        
seeing me so tense, no self-confidence.
                           
The winner takes it all...

There'll come a time               when you regret it.
 Dm    Edim  Dm7               Bb9    
Some   day      when you grow lonely,
      C         C/B         E7               Am      Cdim

Af-ter I'm gone           you're gonna wake up;

You will find you were blind

To let somebody come along and change your mind.

Through joy and tears,            all kinds of weather,

Some day      blue and down-hearted,
        C      C/B     E7            Am        Cdim     
You'll long to be with me again back where you started,

Bb               Gm      Cm              f  
Said I wanna talk to you for a little while
Bb               Gm            Cm                    f   
But before I make my move my emotion starts running wild
Bb              Gm         Cm   f  
My tongue gets tied and tha no lie
                 Bb  Gm Cm 
Looking in your eyes

 Looking in your big brown eyes

 And if you cry out

Amazing grace

Traditional Song


   D               G          D                             A7  
Amazing grace how sweet the sound That saved  a wretch like me
    D                G       D                 A7     D  
I once was lost but now am found Was blind but now I see
 D                          G         D                         A7   
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears relieved
       D               G      D                 A7       D   
How precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed
  D                     G         D                    A7  
Through many dangers, toils and snares I have already come
     D                      G        D                   A7      D   
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far and grace will lead me home
 D                          G       D                          A7  
When we've been there ten thousand years Bright shining as the sun
    D                  G           D                  A7      D  
We've no less days to sing God's praise than when we first begun

Verse 1:
          C#                     D                 
We took a back road, we�re gonna look at the stars

We took a back road in my car
            F#                D             
Down to the ocean, it�s only water and sand
           Ab                C#    
And in the ocean, we�ll hold hands
                  C#        
But I don�t really like you
      D                       B                       C#     
Apologetically dressed in the best, but on a heartbeat glide
           F#                 D                    
Without an answer, the thunder speaks from the sky
           Ab               C#      D 
And on the cold, wet dirt I cry

Like the holiest dream
                F#                 D               
There�s someone calling, an angel whispers my name
        Ab                     C#    D 
But the message relayed is the same  
                            E     
Wait till tomorrow you�ll be fine
                      E7             
But it�s gone to the dogs in my mind
C#       D         Bm       C#      F#m          D      
I Always hear them when the dead of night comes calling
                      
Ab5      C#         D
                            
To save me from this fright

But they can never wrong this right

It Never Rains in Southern California
Hammond &amp; Hazelwoo


      Bm7               E          A     
Got onboard a westbound Seven FortySeven
       Bm7            E              A  D A 
Didn't think before deciding what to do  
         Bm7          E        
All that talk of opportunities
A                F#m         Bm7   E          A    D6 A 
T. V. breaks and movies rang true,  sure rang true  
        
Chorus:
         Bm7            E            A      
Seems it never rains in southern California
           Bm7              E              A    
Seems I've often heard that kind of talk before
         Bm7          E           A               F#m     
It never rains in California, but girl don't they warn ya

It pours,  man it pours  
        
Bridge:
       Bm7                 E    
Out of work, I'm out of my head

I'm out of self-respect, I'm out of bread
          Bm7              E  
I'm under-loved, I'm underfed
           A    
I wanna go home

Will you tell the folks back home I nearly made it

The Boxer

Simon and Garfunkel


D                                             Bm   
I am just a poor boy though my story's seldom told
       A                        
I have squandered my resistance
      Em             A                 D        
For a pocket full of mumbles, such are promises
             Bm            A                 G             
All lies and jest, still a man hears what he wants to hear
                   D    A G G D 
And disregards the rest    
       D                                                Bm  
When I left my home and my family, I was no more than a boy
       A                    
In the company of strangers
       Em         A                D              
In the quiet of a railway station, running scared
       Bm           A              G        
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
                        D  
Where the ragged people go
        A              G    G          D    
Looking for the places only they would know
       Bm          A                         Bm   
Lie la lie, Lie la lie la lie la lie, Lie la lie,
A                           G           D    
Lie la lie la la la la, lie la la la la lie.
       D                                         Bm  
Asking only workman's wages I come looking for a job
             A      
But I get no offers
       Em               A                 D      
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
       Bm                A                G           
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
                    D     
I took some comfort there
A                  G G D 
Lie lie lie lie la   
         D                                              Bm   
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone
      A              Em                    A      D           Bm 
Going home where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me 
        A  G      D     
Leading me, going home.
       D                                            Bm    
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
       A                           A7                       
And he carries a reminder of ev'ry glove that laid him down
   D                                              Bm    
Or cut him till he cried out in his anger and his shame
     A             G       
I am leaving, I am leaving
                        D     
But the fighter still remains
       
Chorus

Am         D        G                 (walkdown*)

Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me
               D                     A       
And when those blue snowflakes start fallin'
                  A7                  D       
That's when those blue memories start callin'
          Am      D               G            E7    
You'll be doin' alright with your Christmas of white

I'll have a blue Christmas that's certain
                  A7                  D     
And when that blue heartache starts hurtin'

You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of whiteH

They Laughed When I Started To Play

Fred E Cliffe - (Best viewed with "Single Rows")


    C                                   
Now when I learned to play the ukulele,
  G7                       C      
I used to practice day and night.
   E7                   Am                  
My pals all roared as I fumbled at a chord,
      D7                      G7           
But I couldn�t get the darned thing right.
     C                         A7         Dm         G7      
They laughed when I started to play, they laughed so hearty.
Dm G7    Am                    D7                               
Only two lessons I had, I went up the scale and down the scale,
   G7             
It wasn�t so bad.
        C                        C7          F           C7   F    
But one chap, he said "Oh what a mug why you can�t learn that way"
                                                 G#7  
He took the uke off me and said "Now I�ll have a try"
     C                            D7         G7            
Just then the �G� string bust and flew right into his eye.
   C                         A7           Dm           D7    G7  C    
He laughed when I started to play, but he didn�t laugh again all day.
                                                                  
Oh they laughed when I started to play, oh they laughed so hearty
                                
Strip poker that�s a good game,
                                           
Once I lost my trousers to a gambling dame
                                                                    
But when, I started shuffling the cards, then the luck came my way.
                                                 
I won a frock and undies, she was left I declare
                                              
As bare as any savage and as savages are bear
                                    
She laughed when I started to play,
                                     
But she didn�t laugh again that day.
                                         
Now once I watched a game of water polo,
                                   
With players from a ladies school.
                                                
The girls all cried "Won�t you make up a side?"
                                   
So I dashed into the bathing pool.
                                                                    
They laughed when I started to play, oh how they laughed so hearty.
                                                                           
In goal, I paddled about, a big ball in the water soon I started to clout.
                                                              
Each time, that it came bobbing back, well I smacked it away.
                                                           
Just then the ball turned over and a girl said "No larks",
                                                          
"Seven times you�ve hit me where I can�t show the marks."
                                    
She laughed when I started to play,
                                     
But she didn�t laugh again that day.

Can't hurry love

Phil Collins


G             C       G               Bm        Em      Am                       
I need love, love to ease my mind and I need to find time, someone to call mine.
D             
My Mama said:
         
Refrain:
    G                        C            G     
You can't hurry love. No you just have to wait.
          Bm              Em        Am             D              
She said: Love don't come easy, but it's a game of give and take.
    G                           C            G     
You can't hurry love. No you'll just have to wait.
     Bm         Em           Am          D       D7     
Just trust on a good time, no matter how long it takes.
         
Strophe:
Bm                                
How many heartaches must I stand,
         Em                                  
before I find the love to let me live again.
              Am                                    
Right now the only thing, that keeps me hangin' on,
       D                          D7                D                
when I feel my strenghth, oh it's almost gone, I remember Mama said:
         
Refrain:
                                                
You can't hurry love. No you just have to wait.
                                                                  
She said: Love don't come easy, but it's a game of give and take.
                                                 
How long must I wait? How much more must I take,
                                                        
before loneliness will 'cause my heart, heart to break?
         
Strophe:
                                       
No I can't bear to live my life alone.
                                            
I grow impatient for a love to call my own.
                                       
But when I feel that I, I can't go on.
                                                                    
Well these Precious words keep me hangin' on, I remember Mama said:
         
Refrain:
                                                
You can't hurry love. No you just have to wait.
                                                                  
She said: Love don't come easy, but it's a game of give and take.
                                                              
You can't hurry love. No you'll just have to wait.          G
                                                                   
Just trust on a good time, no matter how long it takes. Now break!
                               
Strophe: (played like refrain)
                                                                             
Now love, love don't come easy, but I keep on waiting, anticipating for that
                                                                          
soft voice to talk to me at night, for some tender arms to hold me tight.
                                                                                               
I keep waiting, oh 'til that say, but it ain't easy, no, you know it ain't easy. My Mama said:
         
Refrain:
                                                
You can't hurry love. No you just have to wait.
                                                                  
She said: Love don't come easy, but it's a game of give and take.
                                                   
You can't hurry love. No you'll just have to wait.

G                D          Em             D               C 
Looking from the window above, it�s like a story of love   
        G     D  
Can you hear me?
G               D      Em         D           C 
Came back only yesterday, movin' further away 
         G       D 
Want you near me 
C                    D             
All I needed was the love you gave
G                  C         
All I needed for another day
               D          G   
And all I ever knew, only you

G                D            Em              D           C 
Sometimes when I think of her name, when it�s only a game 
      G       D 
And I need you
G             D               Em                D           C  
Listen to the words that you say, �it�s getting harder to stay
       G     D  
When I need you
C                    D             
All I needed was the love you gave

G             D             Em         D               C 
This is gonna take a long time and I wonder what�s mine
          G     D  
Can�t take no more
G                D      Em                 D                  C 
Wonder if you�ll understand, it�s just the touch of your hand 
           G       D  
Behind a closed door
C                    D

CHORUS:
G                          
 Cupid, draw back your bow
C                      
 And let your arrow go
G               D                 G       D  
 Straight to my lover's heart for me, for me
G                          
 Cupid, please hear my cry
c                       
 And let your arrow fly

 Straight to my lover's heart for me------
         
Verse 1:
                                     D7              
Now, I don't mean to bother you, but I'm in distress
                                   G            
There's danger of me losin' all of my happiness
                              C            
For I love a girl who doesn't know I exist

  And this you can fix, so...

Now, Cupid, if your arrow make her love strong for me
                                         
I promise I will love her until eternity
                                                      
I know, between the two of us, her heart we can steal
                           
Help me if you will, so...
         
(chorus)
G                                     
Cupid, don't you hear me calling you?
                  
I need you, Cupid

       G C 
Intro:  
G                                           
When I'm with you baby, I go out of my head
      C                                              
And I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
G                                                   
All the things you do to me and everything you said
      C                                              
And I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
D                       Em           
We slip and slide as we fall in love
      C                  D               G  C 
And I just can't seem to get enough, ahhh   
G                                               
We walk together, we're walking down the street
      C                                              
And I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
G                                                
Every time I think of you I know we have to meet
      C                                              
And I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
D                             Em           
It's getting hotter, it's our burning love
      C                  D               G  C 
And I just can't seem to get enough, ahhh   
G                                             
And when it rains, you're shining down for me
      C                                              
And I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
G                                            
Just like a rainbow you know you set me free
      C                                              
And I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
D                            Em                
You're like an angel and you give me your love
      C                  D               G  C 
And I just can't seem to get enough, ahhh   



Hallelujah, I Love Her So

Ray Charles


A6  A             A9     D9    Fdim  
Let me tell you about a girl I know,
A6    A       A9      D9      Fdim  
She's my baby and she loves me so.
A              A9       A7           D9 
Every morning when the sun comes up, 
               D6          Cdim          
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup.
       Fdim   A    Amaj7    F#7  
That's why I know, yes I know,
     D9            E7       A    E7 
Hallelujah I just love her so.   
     A6      A       A9    D9      Fdim    
When I'm in trouble and I have no friends,
  A6           A      A9    D9    Fdim  
I know she'll go with me until the end.
A          A9      A7           D9 
Ev'rybody asks me how I know.   
   D6                          Cdim        
I smile at them and say, "She told me so."
       Fdim   A    Amaj7    F#7  
That's why I know, oh, I know,
     D9            E7       A    A9   A 
Hallelujah, I just love her so.       
        
Bridge:
D          D9            Dm6   Fdim  
Now, if I call her on the telephone,
A    A6        A      A9    A    
And tell her that I'm all alone.
D       D9               Dm6    Bm7   
By the time I count from one to four,
 D9       Bm7      Bm7      E7   
She'll be knocking  on  my door.
A6      A       A9      D9      Fdim  
In the evening when the sun goes down
 A6        A    A9   D9   Fdim    
When there is nobody else around,
    A          A9      A7             D9 
She kisses me and she holds me tight. 
     D6                   Cdim              
And tells me, "Daddy everything's alright."
       Fdim   A    Amaj7  F#7   
That's why I know, yes, I know,
     D9             E7      A    A9   A 
Hallelujah, I just love her so.       



Dont worry be happy 

Bobby McFerrin


D                             
Here is a little song I wrote
Em                                      
You might want to sing it note for note
G               D    
Don't worry be happy
D                                  
In every life we have some trouble
Em                                
When you worry you make it double
G                 D   
Don't worry, be happy
D                                   
Ain't got no place to lay your head
Em                              
Somebody came and took your bed
G                 D   
Don't worry, be happy
D                                   
The land lord say your rent is late
Em                      
He may have to litigate
G                 D   
Don't worry, be happy
D                                     
Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
Em                                   
Ain't got not girl to make you smile
G                 D      
But don't worry be happy
D                                          
Cause when you worry, your face will frown
Em                                 
And that will bring everybody down
G                 D      
So don't worry, be happy
D                                 
There is this little song I wrote
Em                                
I hope you learn it note for note
G                 D                         
Don't worry, be happy; Listen to what I say
D                                
In your life expect some trouble
Em                                     
But when you worry, you make it double
G                 D   
Don't worry, be happy

I'd love to get you   on a slow boat to China,

Get you and keep you in my arms evermore,
B7    F#m7     B7     Bm7            Bm7-5    E7    
Leave all your lovers weepin' on the faraway shore.
 A C#m7-5   F#7   A7         Bm7           Cdim  
Out on the briny,   with the moon big and shiny,

Melting your heart of stone;    
Bm7-5   E7    C#m7-5   F#7  A    G7      F#7

If you want to play it in the original key, put a capo on the first fret. But thats only for D-tuning.
       D E A F#m  
Intro:     x2
           D        E    
I used to rule the world
            A                    F#m  
Seas would rise when I gave the word
                      D      E   
Now in the morning I sleep alone
           A                 F#m  
Sweep the streets I used to own
D E A F#m  
    x2
            D       E   
I used to roll the dice
         A                   F#m  
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
               D            E  
Listen as the crowd would sing
          A                     F#m             
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
              D        E  
One minute I held the key
           A                   F#m  
Next the walls were closed on me
                           D      E    
And I discovered that my castles stand
       A                   F#m           
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
    D             E              
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
 A              F#m              
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
 D                  E             
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
    A                  F#m         
My missionaries in a foreign field
  D                 E           
For some reason I can't explain
  A                     F#m  
Once you go there was never
           D      E  
Never an honest word
               A                F#m  
And that was when I ruled the world
D E A F#m  
    x2
                        D    E  
It was the wicked and wild wind
                A              F#m  
Blew down the doors to let me in
                            D      E     
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
         A                    F#m       
People couldn't believe what I'd become
           D      E  
Revolutionaries wait
        A                F#m  
For my head on a silver plate
                     D     E     
Just a puppet on a lonely string
              A               F#m  
Oh who would ever want to be king?
   D               E             
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
  A             F#m              
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
 D                E               
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
     A                 F#m         
My missionaries in a foreign field
 D                  E           
For some reason I can't explain
   A                       F#m        
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
           D     E   
Never an honest word
              A

I've Got a Match 

by They Might Be Giants


D                 A  D               B7  
Get out of the car - put down the phone
Em              C              Em       A  
take off that stupid looking hat you wear
                                            
I'm gonna die if you touch me one more time
                                               
well I guess that I'm gonna die no matter what
        
Chorus:
 G                A   
Love people are there
      D       A      G          
the smell of love is everywhere
 A                     G                 
you think it's always sensitive and good
Em                       G             
you think that I want to be understood
 Em         Bm              G       A      D    
I've got a match - your embrace and my collapse
                                                    
Beat up the cat if you want someone else on the mat
                                              
I put a rock in the coffee in your coffee mug
                                                
which one of us is the one that we can't trust?
                                                          
you say that I think it's you but I don't agree with that
        
Chorus:
 G                A   
Love people are there
     D       A      G           
the smell of love is everywhere
 A                G                 
why can't you be sensitive and good
Em                    G              
why don't you want to be understood?
 Em         Bm              G       A      D      A         G        A   
I've got a match - your embrace and my collapse - even when we get along
 Em         Bm             G        A      D    
I've got a match - your embrace and my collapse



Blue Moon

Lorenz Hart &amp; Richard Rodgers


A7   D     Bm7 Em7 
Blue moon,  
           A7        D    Bm7 Em7 
You saw me standing alone  
          E7          Dm7    Bm7 E7 
Without a dream in my heart,  
          G          D    Bm7 Em7 
Without a love of my own.  
A7   D     Bm7 Em7 
Blue moon,  
              A7         D          Bm7 Em7 
You knew just what I was there for,  
             E7       Dm7        Bm7 E7 
You heard me saying a prayer for  
G         A            D         G Gm D 
Someone I really could care for.   
        
Bridge:
               Em7        A7       D       
And then there suddenly appeared before me
         Em7                A7   D     
The only one my heart could ever hold;
            Gm7            C7      F         
I heard somebody whisper, "Please adore me."
           A                    E7        A     E7 A7 
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold.  
A7   D     Bm7 Em7 
Blue moon,  
           A7      D    Bm7 Em7 
Now I'm no longer alone  
          E7          Dm7    Bm7 E7 
Without a dream in my heart,  
          G          D    Bm7 Em7  
Without a love of my own.

I guess I'll have to dream the rest, 
   C9          Cdim        Dm7             G7   
If you can't remember the things that you said,
     C9            Cdim     Dm7              G7    
The nights that my shoulder held your sleepy head;
   CM7              Gdim       F     Fm7 
If you believe that parting's best,  
   Dm7              Fdim          G   
I guess I'll have to  dream the rest.
  Dm7                 G7      C   Am 
I guess I'll have to dream alone  
   C9         Cdim        Dm7          G7   
Of honeymoon cruises once dear to my heart,
    C9       Cdim       Dm7                G7    
Of one room apartments where we said we'd start,
   CM7               Gdim        F   
Of foolish things we planned to own,

Bridge:

I   can see    that your heart has gone astray;

As for me,    I'll love you the same old way.
  Dm7                 G7        C   Am 
I guess I'll have to dream the rest;

There'll be no friends waiting to throw shoes and rice;
C9            Cdim          Dm7          G7   
Those heavenly moments will never come twice;
    CM7              Gdim          A7        
I'm thankful for the hours you've bless'd --
  Dm7                G7         C    
I guess I'll have to dream the rest.

I'm wild again,       beguiled again,
    C         E7        FM7          Fdim 
A simpering, whimpering child again -

The Girl From Ipanema

Music Antonio Carlos Jobim, original words Vinicius de Moraes, english text Norman Gimbel.


Fmaj7                                        
 Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl
G7                                   
 from Ipanema goes walking, and when
Gm7                   Gb7              
 she passes, each one  she passes goes
Fmaj7               Gb9 
 a-a-h...           
Fmaj7                                   
 When she walks she's like a samba that
G7                                             
 swings so cool and sways so gentle, that when
Gm7                   Gb7              
 she passes, each one  she passes goes
Fmaj7               Fmaj7 
 a-a-h...           
Gbmaj7                  
 Oh, but I watch her so
Cb9     
 sadly.
F#m7                  
 How can I tell her I
D9         
 love her?
Gm7                         
 Yes, I would give my heart
Eb9                    
 gladly.      But each
Am7                        D7-9      
 day when she walks to the  sea, she
Gm7                          C7-9  
 looks straight ahead not at  me.
Fmaj7                                       
 Tall and tan and young and lovely the girl
G7                                   
 from Ipanema goes walking, and when
Gm7                  Gb7

    Bb                       C7                   
Now  I go window cleaning to  earn an honest bob.
F                                       Bb   
 For a nosey parker it's an interesting  job
Bb                   Bb7             
 Now it's a job that  just suits me,
Eb                C7            
 A window cleaner  you will be.
   Bb                  G7         
If  you could see what  I can see
Gb7                Bb        
 When I'm cleaning  windows.
Bb                Bb7           
 The honeymooning  couples too,
Eb                   C7             
 You should see them  bill and coo.
      Bb               G7              
You'd  be surprised at  things they do
Gb7                Bb        
 When I'm cleaning  windows.
D7                             G7                    
 In my profession I work hard,  but I'll never stop.
C7                               F                        F7    
 I'll climb this blinking ladder  'til I get right to the  top.
Bb                      Bb7            
 The blushing bride she  looks divine,
    Eb                C7          
The  bridegroom he is  doing fine
    Bb               G7             
I'd  rather have his  job than mine
Gb7                Bb        
 When I'm cleaning  windows.
Bb                     Bb7            
 The chambermaid sweet  names I call,
       Eb      C7             
It's a  wonder  I don't fall.
   Bb              G7           
My minds not on my  work at all
Gb7                Bb       
 When I'm cleaning  windows
Bb               Bb7            
 I know a fellow  such a swell,
         Eb           C7              
He has a  thirst it's  plain to tell.
     Bb                  G7            
I've  seen him drink his  bath as well
Gb7                Bb           
 When I'm cleaning  windows, oh
D7                             G7

C7                               F                        F7    
 I'll climb this blinking ladder  'til I get right to the  top.
Bb             Bb7           
 Pyjamas lying  side by side
Eb               C7            
 ladies nighties I have spied.
     Bb               G7            
I've  often seen what  goes inside,

 when I'm cleaning  windows.
             
instrumental
Bb                Bb7            
 There's a famous  talkie queen,
Eb               C7              
 looks a flapper  on the screen.
      Bb                G7             
She's  more like eighty  than eighteen
Gb7                Bb        
 When I'm cleaning  windows.
Bb                      Bb7           
 She pulls her hair all  down behind,
     Eb               C7               
Then  pulls down her,  never mind, and
      Bb          G7              
After  that pulls  down the blind
Gb7                Bb

 I'll climb this blinking ladder 'til I get right to the  top.
Bb                Bb7               
An old maid walks  around the floor
Eb                    C7                    
 She's so fed up one   day I'm sure, she'll
Bb              G7             
 drag me in and  lock the door
Gb7                Bb

I WALK THE LINE




C        G7                           C    
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
          G7                     C     
I keep my eyes wide open all the time.
           F                         C     
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
               G7               C    
Because you're mine, I walk the line
          G7                    C    
I find it very, very easy to be true
         G7                     C       
I find myself alone when day is through
          F                         C   
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
               G7               C    
Because you're mine, I walk the line
           G7                       C     
As sure as night is dark and day is light
           G7                      C     
I keep you on my mind both day and night
         F                                C     
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
               G7               C    
Because you're mine, I walk the line
             G7                     C    
You've got a way to keep me on your side
            G7                          C    
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
          F                      C    
For you I know I'd even turn the tide
                G7              C    
Because you're mine, I walk the line
         G7                           C    
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
          G7                     C     
I keep my eyes wide open all the time.
           F                         C     
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
               G7               C    
Because you're mine, I walk the line
          G7                       C     
I keep my pants up with a piece of twine
           G7                        C     
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
          F                      C    
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
             G7                    C        
So if you're mine, PLEASE PULL THE TWINE!!!

Always look on the bright Side of Life

Monti Python


     Am                 D            G               Em  
Some things in life are bad they can really make you mad
      Am                   D         G     
Other things just make you swear and curse
            Am                D       
When you've chewing an life's gristle
      G              Em      
Don't grumble give a whistle
    Am                                   D7   
And this'll help things turn out for the best
    G      Em          Am     D7      G      Em    Am    D7 
And always look on the bright side of life               
   G   Em          Am    D7      G     Em    Am    D7 
Always look on the light side of life              
   Am               D              G                Em        
If life seems jolly rotten there's something you've forgotten
              Am                  D         G     
and that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing.
            Am             D              G     Em     
When you've feeling in the dumps don't be silly chumps
     Am                                       D7    
Just purse your lips and whistle - that's the thing
    G      Em          Am     D7      G      Em    Am    D7 
And always look on the bright side of life               
           G   Em          Am    D7        G     Em    Am    D7 
Come on always look on the bright side of life               
     Am               D        G               Em   
For life is quite absurd and death's the final word
         Am              D              G   
you must always face the curtain with a bow
   Am             D              G          Em   
Forget about your sin - give the audience a grin
  Am                                D7   
Enjoy it - it's your last chance anyhow.
    G      Em          Am     D7      G      Em    Am    D7 
So always look on the bright side of death               
G      Em       Am           D7    G         Em    Am    D7 
just before you draw your terminal breath                
Am               D    G                Em  
Life's a pice if shit when you look at it
Am                 D                   G    
Life's a laugh and death's a joke it's true
       Am             D    
You'll see it's all a show
        G               Em  
keep'em laughing as you go
       Am                               D7

Mama mia 

ABBA


D         A          D                       G    
I've been cheated by you, since I don't know when
D    A          D                        G   
So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
D               D                  
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
D              D                 G            
I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
                   A          
There's a fire within my soul
G    D     A                               
Just one   look and I can hear a bell ring
G   D    A                             
One more look and I forget everything,
D                          
Mamma mia, here I go again
C   G               D         
My  my, how can I resist you?
D                              
Mamma mia, does it show again?
C   G                      D          
My  my, just how much I've missed you
D              A             
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Bm             F#m           
Blue since the day we parted
C    G   Em         A           
Why, why did I ever let you go?
D         Bm                  
Mamma mia, now I really know,
C    G   Em            A           
My   my, I could never let you go.
D 

D         A         D                             G  
I've been angry and sad about the things that you do
D       A             D                              G       
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
D               D                       
And when you go, when you slam the door
D              D                    G             
I think you know, that you won't be away too long
                  A                
You know that I'm not that strong.
G    D     A                               
Just one   look and I can hear a bell ring
G   D    A                             
One more look and I forget everything,
D                          
Mamma mia, here I go again
C   G               D         
My  my, how can I resist you?
D                              
Mamma mia, does it show again?
C   G                      D          
My  my, just how much I've missed you
D              A             
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Bm             F#m           
Blue since the day we parted
C    G   Em         A           
Why, why did I ever let you go?
D                        
Mamma mia, even if I say
C   G                    D     
Bye bye, leave me now or never
D                              
mamma mia, it's a game we play
C   G                   D    
Bye bye doesn't mean forever

Ricky Martin


Dm                            
Talk to me, tell me your name
    A7                                 
You blow me off like it's all the same
                                                Dm   
You lit a fuse and now I'm tickin' away, like a bomb

Talk to me, tell me your sign
A7                                   
You're switchin' sides like a Gemini

    A7                                                 
She walks like she talks, and she talks like she walks

(And) She Bangs, she bangs

I go crazy

(I'm ) wasted by the way she moves
                           
No one ever looked so fine

Talk to me, tell me your name
A7                                  
I'm just a link in your daisy chain

Your rap sounds like a diamond map, to the stars
          
Yeah baby
Dm                           
Talk to me, tell me the news
A7                                   
You wear me out like a pair of shoes
                                                  Dm   
We'll dance until the band goes home, then you're gone
          
Yeah baby

(You'd) better lock me up for life
    E7                                   
I'll do the time with a smile on my face
A7                                      
Thinkin' of her in her leather and lace
       
CHORUS
        Gm                        
Well if Lady Luck gets on my side

Dirty Old Town
Ewan McCol


         E                          
I met my love by the gasworks door;
          A                  E    
Dreamed a dream by the old canal.
          C#m                 E     
Kissed my girl by the factory wall.
          F#m   B7         C#m   
Dirty old town,  dirty old town.
            E                        
The moon is shifting behind a cloud,
         A                      E     
Cats are crawling all along the beat,
          C#m                    E      
Springs a girl in the streets at night.
          F#m   B7         C#m   
Dirty old town,  dirty old town.
          E                             
I heard a whistle coming from the docks
      A                      E     
And a train set the night on fire,
            C#m                      E    
Smelled the spring on a smoke-filled air.
          F#m   B7         C#m   
Dirty old town,  dirty old town.
          E                        
I'm gonna get me a nice sharp axe,
        A                   E     
Shining steel tempered in a fire,
        C#m                   E     
Cut you down like an old dead tree,
          F#m   B7         C#m   
Dirty old town,  dirty old town.

Folsom Prison Blues

Johnny Cash


A                                                    
I hear the train acoming it's rolling round the bend
                                                A7   
and I ain't seen the sunshine sine I don't know when
    D                                              A  
I'm stuck at Folsom Prison and time keeps draggin' on
         E7                                    A   
But that train keeps rollin' on down to San Antone
A                                           
When I was just a baby my Mama told me 'Son
                                           A7    
always be a good boy; don't ever play with guns.
      D                                       A   
But I shot the man in Reno, just to watch him die
       E7                                           A   
when I hear that whistle blowin' I hang my head and cry
                          
Solo (instrumental verse)
A                                                       
I bet there's rich folks eatin', in a fancy dining car,
                                                  A7      
They're probably drinkin' coffee, and smokin' big cigars,
      D                                       A     
But I know I had it comin', I know I can't be free,
          E7                                             A   
But those people keep a-movin', and that's what tortures me.
                          
Solo (instrumental verse)
A                                                                         
Well, if they freed me from this prison, If that railroad train was mine,
                                                   A7    
I bet I'd move out over a little, farther down the line,
    D                                          A     
Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I want to stay,
        E7                                         A   
And I'd let that lonesome whistle, blow my blues away.

Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow

Carole King


       
Intro:
C F G7 
    
C                      F         G7 
Tonight you're mine completely,  
C                     G        
You give your love so sweetly,
  E         E7       Am                    
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes,
F            G7        C       
But will you love me tomorrow?
C                 F          G7 
Is this a lasting treasure,  
C                  G         
Or just a moment's pleasure,
    E   E7         Am                  
Can I believe the magic of your sighs,
F              G7        C       
Will you still love me tomorrow?
F                    C       
Tonight with words unspoken,
F             G7           C    
You said that I'm the only one,
F                    C       
But will my heart be broken,
         Am                     
When the night (When the night)
          D7      F      G7 
Meets the morning sun.   
C                     F          G7 
I'd like to know that your love, 
C                G             F  
Is love I can be sure of,      So
E       E7       Am                
Tell me now and I won't ask again,
F              G7        C       
Will you still love me tomorrow?
F              G7        C       
Will you still love me tomorrow?



Positively 4th Street

Bob Dylan


G             am              C                G   
You've got a lot of nerve to say you are my friend
  G         D    C         em7         Dsus4 D 
When I was down you just stood there grinning
G             am              C                             G   
You've got a lot of nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend
 G        D       C         em7         D      
You just want to be on the side that's winning
                       
You say I let you down
                            
You know it's not like that
                  
If you're so hurt
                           
Why then don't you show it
                            
You say you lost your faith
                             
But that's not where it's at
                         
You had no faith to lose
                
And you know it
                  
I know the reason
                             
That you talk behind my back
                             
I used to be among the crowd
               
You're in with
                               
Do you take me for such a fool
                          
To think I'd make contact
                               
With the one who tries to hide
                                 
What he don't know to begin with
                         
You see me on the street
                         
You always act surprised
                                    
You say, "How are you?" "Good luck"
                      
But you don't mean it
                            
When you know as well as me
                              
You'd rather see me paralyzed
                                 
Why don't you just come out once
              
And scream it
                            
No, I do not feel that good
                                       
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
                        
If I was a master thief
                     
Perhaps I'd rob them
                                   
And now I know you're dissatisfied
                                  
With your position and your place
                     
Don't you understand
                    
It's not my problem
                              
I wish that for just one time
                                
You could stand inside my shoes
                             
And just for that one moment
               
I could be you
                                   
Yes, I wish that for just one time
                                
You could stand inside my shoes
                             
You'd know what a drag it is
           
To see you



Mr. Fancy Pants

Jonathan Coulton


E                                                   
Chances are your pants are not as fancy as the pair
   F#m                       B                     
Of very fancy pants that Mr. Fancy Pants will wear
     E                                 E/D   C#7    
When everybody�s marching in the fancy pants parade
     F#m            B    
He�s gonna pass the test
     F#m          B    
He�s gonna be the best
    F#m     B        E    B7 E 
The best in terms of pants
E                                                 
You look in every catalog you shop at every store
      F#m                            B                        
Cause even though you have a hundred pants you want some more
     E                                          E/D  C#7  
When suddenly you see the greatest pants you�ve ever seen
    F#m             B    
And even though you know
           F#m           B     
It�s gonna cost a lot of dough
    F#m              B            E    B7 E 
You have to have the world�s best pants   
A            Bdim/A         A          Bdim/A 
Say a little prayer for Mr. Fancy Pants
    Dm(maj7)    Dm6   
The whole world knows
     Dm(maj7) Dm6     
It�s only     clothes
    Cmaj7  C    
And deep inside
     Esus4/B B7 
He�s sad     
     E                                                    
They make the big announcement and the trophy goes to you
    F#m                                  B                      
You thought you had some fancy pants and now you know it�s true
    E                                    E/D    C#7  
You look at Mr. Fancy Pants and hold the trophy high
F#m       B      
Everybody cheers
           F#m               B     
While he�s blinking back the tears
    F#m         B             E    B7 E 
He doesn�t even have the best pants   
A            Bdim/A         A          Bdim/A 
Say a little prayer for Mr. Fancy Pants
     Dm(maj7) Dm6  
It�s all he   had
    Dm(maj7)   Dm6  
But don�t feel bad
     Cmaj7  C    
He�d do the same
   Esus4/B B7 
To you

As long as we're together, it really doesn't matter at all.
                                                
When they've all had their quarrels and parted,
                                 
We'll be the same as we started,
                                                    
Just trav'lin' along, singin' a song, side by side.

Its hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralysed
                                                                 
And the wants and the needs of a woman your age, Ruby I realize,
                                                              
But it won't be long i've heard them say until I�m not around
             
Oh Ruby-----
                             
Don't Take your love to town
Verse 3.

   Em                              D               
It wasn't me that started that old crazy asian war
   Em                           G         A7    
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore
   Em                               A7                   Em 
And yes, it's true that I'm not the man I used to be...  
    D   G Em     
Oh Ruby   (Stop)
                        D  
I still need some company.
V4 (Same as V1)

                                                          
She's leavin' now 'cause I heard the slammin' of the door
                                                           
The way I know I've heard it slam one hundred times before
                                                             
And if I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground
             
Oh Ruby-----
                            
For God's sake turn around!

ISTANBUL




Am                                                                 
Istanbul was Constantinople, now it's Istanbul, not Constantinople
       E7                                 
Been a long time gone, old Constantinople
         Am        Dm         Dm      Am    
Now it's Turkish delight on a moonlit night
Am                                                                
Every gal in Constantinople lives in Istanbul, not Constantinople
      E7                                         Am         E7    Am  
So if you've a date in Constantinople, she'll be waiting in Istanbul
     Am                                  
Even old New York was once New Amsterdam
Bm7                 E7           Am                   E7              
Why they changed it I can't say, people just liked it better that way
   Am              Am                     Am               Am             
So take me back to Constantinople, no you can't go back to Constantinople
         E7            E7                      Am                     Am     
Now it's Istanbul, not Constantinople, why did Constantinople get the works?
              
(half tempo):
       E7                        Am    
That's nobody's business but the Turks



Looking at the World Through a Windshield

Son Volt


A                                       
Well when I was just a little bitty kid
  D                            
I remember one time Momma said
      E                                 A   
Daddy sends you all his love, from East LA.
       A                                  
Well I didn't understand till I was grown
       D7                                   
Why my Daddy didn't spend more time at home
           E                               A    
Instead of running round the country, that way.
        A                              E           
Now I'm looking at the world through a windshield,
                              A      
Watching it pass by me on the right.
                                                    D7        
I got a sweet little thing I'm dying to see down in Nashville
        E                                         A      
And I'm down around Dallas, rollin� into Saturday night.
A                                  
Long strips of rubber that you see
      D                                
Burnt off this rig by the likes of me,
            E                              A     
and they'll rot along the highways of this land.
A                                        
Gonna write my name in the diesel smoke,
        D7                                   
Let the ones that come along behind me choke
           E                                  A    
and try to keep this pace I'm setting if they can.
        A                              E           
Now I'm looking at the world through a windshield,
                              A

A                                                
Well I�ve pushed this rig through sleet and rain
         D                              
And I've driven over some rough terrain
         E                             A  
from the Rockies to the docks of old L.A.
A                                        
I�ll move on down that old pacific shore
           D7                           
then swing north and head for Baltimore
        E                       A    
Or some place 'bout 2000 miles away.
        A                              E           
Now I'm looking at the world through a windshield,

That I used to know... so long ago

On the beach at Honaunau

"Komo mai no kaua i ka hale welakahau"
            G                                 
It won't be long till my ship will be sailing

Back to Kona
  D7              
A grand old place
                      B7                       
That's always fair to see... you're telling me
    E7                                               
I'm just a little Hawaiian and a homesick island boy
  A7                                 
I want to go back to my fish and poi

I want to go back to my little grass shack

In Kealakekua, Hawaii

Where the humu-humu nuku-nuku a pua'a
            G  
Go swimming by

She Thinks I Still Care

He sticks out his chest, two pillows in his vest
  D7                                      G     
A bolster under his rotunda, our Sergeant Major
    G                           Am                     
His medals break our hearts, he won them playing darts
    D7                                               G     
And while competing, who was cheating � our Sergeant Major
     Bm           F#7          Bm             
He�s far away the worst friend we�ve ever had
Am             F#        Am           D7   
When he�s far away, well we�re mighty glad
G                       Am                      
In the canteen bar, you know what sergeants are
D7                                                       G     
When we�ve passed out, who�s the last out � our Sergeant Major
                                                    
He�s got a raucous voice, his language isn�t choice
                                                              
In clink we�d shove him, how we love him � our Sergeant Major
                                                   
His weight about he�ll throw, the wicked so-and-so
                                                       
Who�d even smother his own mother � our Sergeant Major
                                              
He�s far away the worst friend we�ve ever had
                                           
When he�s far away, well we�re mighty glad
                                                     
Our bugler goes his round, and when the bugle sounds
                                                                 
Forever lasting, who�s he blasting � our Sergeant Major / solo /
                                                       
Now he makes raw recruits, just tremble in their boots
                                                                 
He calls them slackers, who�s gone crackers � our Sergeant Major
                                                        
His feet fill up the road, knock-knee�d and pigeon toed
                                                            
We�d sooner shoot him, than salute him � our Sergeant Major
                                              
He�s far away the worst friend we�ve ever had
                                           
When he�s far away, well we�re mighty glad
                                                 
The mascot goat we own, so big and fat has grown
                                                          
Wild and warlike, he�s far more like � our Sergeant Major

Gold dust at my feet

Whiskey in the jar
Traditiona


   D                    Bm                         
As I was goin' over the far famed Kerry mountains,
  G                                D              Bm     
I met with Captain Farrell and his money he was count'n.
  D                             Bm                     
I first produced me pistol, and then I drew me rapier,
       G                       D            Bm     
Sayin' stand and deliver for I am a bold deceiver.
        
chorus:
      A7               
Musha rig um du rum da
D            D7      
Whack fol de daddy o
G                    
Whack fol de daddy o
        D       A7     D   
There's whiskey in the jar
   D                            Bm                   
He counted out his money and it made a pretty penny,
  G                         D               Bm     
I put it in me pocket and I took it home to Jenny.
    D                             Bm                     
She smiled and she swore that she never would betray me,
        G                             D            Bm    
But the divil take the women for they ne'er can be easy.
        
Chorus:
  D                        Bm                    
I went into me chamber all for to take a slumber
  G                                 D              Bm      
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure it was no wonder,
D                             Bm                             
But Jenny drew me charges and she filled them up with water,
    G                              D             Bm         
And sent for Captain Farrel, to be ready for the slaughter.
        
Chorus:
      D                      Bm                     
'Twas early in the morning before I rose to travel,
   G                           D                Bm       
Up comes a band of footmen and likewise Captain Farrell;
D                                       Bm              
I first produced me pistol, for Jenny'd stole me rapier
      G                               D              Bm     
But I could na' shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken.
        
Chorus:
     D                          Bm                       
They throwed me into prison without no judge nor writin'
    G                             D       Bm       
For robbin' Captain Farrell up on Kilgary Mountain
         D                          Bm                      
But they did not take me fists so I knocked the jailer down
      G                       D             Bm   
And I bid meself adieu to the jail in Sligo Town
        
Chorus:
    D                             Bm                   
And if anyone can aid me, 'tis me brother in the army,
   G                            D             Bm      
If I could learn his station in Cork or in Killarney.
D                                    Bm                       
And if he'd come and join me we'd go roving through Kilkenny,
     G                                   D                Bm     
I'll engage he'd treat me fairer than me darlin' sportin' Jenny.
        
Chorus:
    D                         Bm                      
Now some takes delight in the boxin' and the bowlin',
    G                              D               Bm       
and some gets their delight in the hurlin' and the rollin'.
D                             Bm                   
Well I gets my delight in the juice of the barley,
    G                             D             Bm     
And courtin' pretty ladies in the mornin' ah so early.
        
Chorus:

Reflections in my mind thoughts I can't define

My heart is racing and the night goes on
E7                                                   
I can almost hear a laugh coming from your fotograph

Funny, how a look can share a thousand meanings

Well intended lies contemplating alibis

Recorded by Roger Williams, 1955 (#1 for 4 weeks)

 Em  Em9   Em     Am7   D7               GM7   G6 
The  au - tumn leaves       drift by my window,
            Am6   B7               Em  Em9  Em 
The autumn leaves     of red and gold.      
Em  Em9   Em   Am7  D7               GM7      G6 
I   see  your lips,      the summer kisses,   
                Am6   B7             Em   
The sunburned hands       I used to hold.
  B+  Em   B7	                     Em    
Since you went away, the days grow long,
    Em7   Em  D7        D    D7     G    
And soon I'll hear old win - ter's song;
     CdimIV   CdimI     B7      Em   Em9   Em 
But I miss you most of all, my Dar - ling, 
      A   Am7   B7               Em   Am7   Am6   Em(9) 
When au - tumn leaves start to fall.

D               E7   
Pennies from heaven.
A         C#m       B7sus4   B7    
Don't you know each cloud contains
D               E7   
Pennies from heaven?
A7                               D    Aaug D   F#7 
You'll find your fortune falling all over town

Be sure that your umbrella is upside down

Trade them for a package of
D               E7   
Sunshine and flowers
A      C#m      A9         A7   
If you want the things you ove,
D                Bm    
You must have showers.
D           Bm      F#m      C#m7-5            F#7  
So when you hear it thunder, don't run under a tree
            B7                      E7      A  
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me

I Can't Get You Off Of My Mind

Hank Williams (Sr.)


      D             A         D    
Oh, I can't get you off of my mind
                     D7         A    
When I try I 'm just wastin' my time
           D               D7            G7               D     
Lord I 've tried and I 've tried and all  nightlong I 've cried
                    A         D     
But I can't get you off of my mind.
         D               A           D   
I didn't think you would leave me behind
                       D7         A    
But I guess you're the two-timin' kind
       D               D7       G7                 D     
Do you think that it's smart to jump from heart to heart
                     A         D     
When I can't get you off of my mind.
       D           A           D     
You believe that a new love is blind
                  D7            A    
So you fool ev'ry true love you find
           D             D7            G7             D    
You've got stars in your eyes but they can't hide the lies
                    A      D     
Oh, I can't get you off my mind.
         D               A           D   
I didn't think you would leave me behind
                       D7         A    
But I guess you're the two-timin' kind
       D               D7       G7                 D     
Do you think that it's smart to jump from heart to heart
                     A         D     
When I can't get you off of my mind.



Just A Gigolo

Lyrics: Irving   Caesar Music: Leonello Casucci 


G              G9              
Just a gigolo, everywhere I go
G               Edim      Am7     D7 
People know the part I'm playing; 
Am              Am+7   Am7          Am6    
Paid for every dance, selling each romance
Am7               D9   D7    G6        Am7  D7 
Every night some heart be - tray - ing.     
G          G+7    G7  Cmaj7           Cmaj7   
There will come a day youth will pass away --
Bm7                 E7   Am       Amaj7 
Then what will they say about me? 
         C             Cm                   G     B7    E7  
When the end comes, I know, they'll say,  "Just a gi-go-lo"
    Am7      D9  D7    G9   G  
As life goes on with - out me.
